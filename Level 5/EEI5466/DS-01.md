# Query Languages

A query language is a <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">specialized computer programming language designed to interact with databases and information systems.</mark> It allows users to:

- **Retrieve data:** <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Extract specific information stored</mark> within a database that meets particular criteria.
- **Modify data:** <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Insert new data, update existing information, or delete records.</mark>
- **Manage database structures:** <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Create, modify, or delete database objects</mark> like tables and indexes.

**Types of Query Languages**

- **Formal Query Languages**
    
    - **Relational Algebra:** A procedural language defining operations to obtain desired results from relations (tables).
    - **Relational Calculus:** A declarative language focusing on the characteristics of the desired result rather than the steps to achieve it.
- **Practical Query Languages**
    
    - **SQL (Structured Query Language):** The most widely used query language for relational databases. It combines elements of relational algebra and calculus, offering a balance of power and ease of use.
- **Specialized Query Languages**
    
    - **GraphQL:** A query language for APIs, often used in web development to give clients more control over the data they fetch.
    - **XQuery:** Designed for querying XML data.

## Relational Algebra

Relational algebra is a <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">formal query language that operates on relations </mark>(tables in a relational database). It's a procedural language, meaning it defines a sequence of operations to achieve the desired query result.

**Key Operators and Notations**

- **Selection (σ):** Selects rows from a relation based on a specified condition.
- **Projection (π):** Creates a new relation by selecting certain attributes from an existing relation.
- **Set operations:**
    - **Union (∪):** Combines the rows of two relations.
    - **Intersection (∩):** Keeps only the rows that are present in both relations.
    - **Difference (−):** Keeps only the rows that are in the first relation but not in the second relation.
- **Cartesian product (×):** Creates a new relation by combining all rows from one relation with all rows from another relation.
- **Join (⋈):** Combines rows from two relations based on a shared attribute and a join condition.

### Selection Operator (σ)

- **Purpose:** The selection operator <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">extracts a subset of rows (tuples) from a relation based on a specified condition.</mark> It creates a new relation containing only the rows that satisfy the selection condition.

- **Notation:**
    
    - `σ_{condition} (R)`
    - Where:
        - `R` is the input relation
        - `condition` is a predicate typically involving comparisons (=, <, >, ≤, ≥, ≠) and logical operators (AND, OR, NOT).
- **How it works:** The selection operator examines each row of the relation 'R'. If a row fulfills the specified condition, it is included in the resulting relation. Otherwise, it is discarded.

**Query:** Find the employees from the 'Marketing' department.

- **Relational Algebra Expression:**
$$
σ_{Department = 'Marketing'} (Employee) 
$$
**Explanation:**

1. The selection operator ($\sigma$) takes the 'Employee' relation as input.
2. The condition (`Department = 'Marketing'`) checks each row.
3. Only the rows where the 'Department' attribute has the value 'Marketing' will be included in the output relation.

### Project Operator (π)

- **Purpose:** The project operator <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">creates a new relation by selecting a subset of the attributes (columns) from an existing relation.</mark> It eliminates duplicate rows from the result.
    
- **Notation:**
    
    - `π_{attribute1, attribute2, ...} (R)`
    - Where:
        
        - `R` is the input relation
        - `attribute1, attribute2, ...` represent the list of attributes to be included in the result.
        
    
- **How it works:**
    
    2. The project operator selects the specified columns from each row of the input relation 'R'.
    4. It then removes any duplicate rows from the result, ensuring that each unique combination of the projected attributes appears only once.

**Query:** Get a list of product names and their prices.

- **Relational Algebra Expression:**
$$
 π_{ProductName, Price} (Product)
$$  

**Explanation:**

1. The projection operator (`π`) takes the 'Product' relation as input.
2. It keeps only the 'ProductName' and 'Price' columns from each row.
3. If there are duplicate combinations of 'ProductName' and 'Price', they are removed, providing a unique list of product names and their associated prices.

### Rename Operator (ρ  )

- **Purpose:** The rename operator <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">changes the name of a relation, its attributes, or both.</mark> It provides flexibility in customizing the output of relational algebra operations.
    
- **Notations:**
    
    - **Renaming a Relation:**
        
        - `ρ_{new\_name}(R)`
        - Where:
            - `R` is the original relation
            - `new_name` is the desired new name for the relation
    - **Renaming Attributes:**
        
        - `ρ_{attribute\_old\_name → attribute\_new\_name}(R)`
        - Where:
            - `R` is the original relation
            - `attribute_old_name` is the existing attribute name
            - `attribute_new_name` is the desired new name for the attribute

**How it Works**

The rename operator essentially creates a copy of the input relation with the specified modifications in names. It does not alter the underlying data itself, only the way it is represented.

1. **Renaming the relation:**

$$
ρ_{ClientData} (Customer)
$$
This creates a new relation named 'ClientData' with the same content as the original 'Customer' relation.

2. **Renaming an attribute:**


$$
ρ_{CustID → ClientID} (Customer) 
$$  
This creates a new relation where the attribute 'CustID' is renamed to 'ClientID', while the other attributes remain the same.

### Cartesian Product Operator (×)

- **Purpose:** The Cartesian product operator combines two relations by pairing each row (tuple) of the first relation with every row of the second relation. The result is a new relation that contains all possible combinations of rows from the input relations.
    
- **Notation:**
    
    - `R × S`
    - Where:
        
        - `R` is the first relation
        - `S` is the second relation
        
    
- **How it Works:**
    
    2. Consider each row in the first relation (`R`).
    4. For each row in `R`, combine it with every row in the second relation (`S`).
    6. Each of these combinations forms a new row in the output relation.

Consider two relations:

- **Customer:** (CustomerID, Name)
- **Orders:** (OrderID, CustomerID, Product)

**Query:** Find all possible combinations of customers and their orders (regardless of whether a customer actually has a corresponding order).

- **Relational Algebra Expression:**

$$
Customer \times Orders
$$
**Explanation:**

- The Cartesian product will take every row from 'Customer' and combine it with every row from 'Orders'.
- If 'Customer' has 3 rows and 'Orders' has 5 rows, the result will have 3 * 5 = 15 rows.

**Union Operator (∪)**

- **Purpose:** The union operator <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">combines the rows of two relations into a single result relation.</mark> For the operation to be valid, the relations must be union-compatible.
    
- **Union Compatibility:** Two relations are union-compatible if:
    
    1. They have the same number of attributes.
    2. The corresponding attributes have the same domains (data types).
- **Notation:**
    
    - `R ∪ S`
    - Where:
        - `R` is the first relation.
        - `S` is the second relation.
- **How it Works:**
    
    1. The union operator takes all rows present in relation `R`.
    2. It then appends all rows from relation `S` that are _not already present_ in `R`.
    3. Duplicate rows are eliminated, ensuring each unique row appears only once in the result.

Consider two relations:

- **Employees_Dept1:** (EmployeeID, Name, Department)
- **Employees_Dept2:** (EmployeeID, Name, Department)

**Query:** Find all employees working in either department.

- **Relational Algebra Expression:**

$$
\text{EmployeesDept1} \cup \text{EmployeesDept2}
$$
**Explanation:**

- Assuming both relations are union-compatible, the union operator will:
    - Combine all the rows from `Employees_Dept1`.
    - Add any rows from `Employees_Dept2` that represent employees not already included from `Employees_Dept1`.


### Intersection Operator (∩)

- **Purpose:** The intersection operator finds the rows that are common to two relations. It produces a new relation containing only the rows that appear in both input relations. Similar to the union operator, the relations must be union-compatible.
    
- **Notation:**
    
    - `R ∩ S`
    - Where:
        - `R` is the first relation
        - `S` is the second relation
- **How it Works:**
    
    1. The intersection operator examines each row in the first relation (`R`).
    2. It checks if an identical row (having the same values for all attributes) exists in the second relation (`S`).
    3. If a match is found, that row is included in the output relation.


Consider two relations:

- **Customers_US:** (CustomerID, Name, Country)
- **Customers_Premium:** (CustomerID, Name, MembershipTier)

**Query:** Find the customers who are both from the US and have a premium membership.

- **Relational Algebra Expression:**
  
$$  
\text{CustomersUS} \cap \text{CustomersPremium}
$$
    

**Explanation**

- The intersection operator will:
    - Look for 'CustomerID' values that exist in both the 'Customers_US' and 'Customers_Premium' relations.
    - The output will only include customers where the 'Country' is 'US' _and_ who have a 'MembershipTier' recorded.


### Set Difference Operator (−)

- **Purpose:** The set difference operator identifies the rows present in the first relation but not in the second relation. Like the union and intersection operators, the relations must be union-compatible.
    
- **Notation:**
    
    - `R − S`
    - Where:
        - `R` is the first relation
        - `S` is the second relation
- **How it Works:**
    
    1. The difference operator examines each row in the first relation (`R`).
    2. It checks if an identical row (having the same values for all attributes) exists in the second relation (`S`).
    3. If a match is _not_ found, the row from `R` is included in the output relation.

Consider two relations:

- **All_Products:** (ProductID, ProductName, Category)
- **Discontinued_Products:** (ProductID, ProductName, DiscontinuedDate)

**Query:** Find the products that are currently active (not discontinued).

- **Relational Algebra Expression:**
 
```
All_Products − Discontinued_Products 
``` 

**Explanation**

- The difference operator will:
    - Take each product from 'All_Products'.
    - Keep only the products whose 'ProductID' does _not_ appear in the 'Discontinued_Products' relation.


**Join Operator (⋈)**

- **Purpose:** The join operator combines rows from two relations based on a common attribute and a specified join condition. It's a powerful tool for linking related data across tables in a relational database.
    
- **Notation:**
    
    - `R ⋈_{condition} S`
    - Where:
        - `R` and `S` are the relations to be joined.
        - `condition` specifies the criteria for matching rows.
- **How it Works:**
    
    1. **Cartesian Product:** Conceptually, a join starts with a Cartesian product (every row from `R` combined with every row from `S`).
        
    2. **Filtering:** The join condition is applied to this initial result. Only the row combinations that satisfy the condition are included in the final output.
        

### Types of Joins

- **Theta Join:** The most general type of join. The 'condition' can involve any comparison operators (=, <, >, ≤, ≥, ≠ ).
    
    - Example: `Customer ⋈_{Customer.City = Orders.ShippingCity} Orders`
- **Natural Join (⋈):** A specialized theta join where the condition is based on equality between attributes having the same name in both relations.
    
    - If 'Customer' and 'Orders' both have a 'CustomerID' attribute, the natural join would be written: `Customer ⋈ Orders`.
- **Equijoin:** A theta join where the condition only uses the equality comparison operator (=).
    
- **Outer Joins:** Variations of joins that preserve rows from one or both tables even if they don't have a match in the other table. Types include:
    
    - **Left Outer Join:** Keeps all rows from the left (first) relation.
	    - ![[Pasted image 20240224132802.png|50]]
    - **Right Outer Join:** Keeps all rows from the right (second) relation.
	    - ![[Pasted image 20240224132841.png|50]]
    - **Full Outer Join:** Keeps all rows from both relations.
