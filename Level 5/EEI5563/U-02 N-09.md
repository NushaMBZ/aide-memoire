## Performance Metrics for Operating Systems

- **Responsiveness**
    - **Response Time:** Time it takes the OS to react to a user's request. Fast response times are crucial for a good user experience.
- **Efficiency**
    - **Throughput:** The rate at which the OS completes transactions or tasks. High throughput means greater processing power.
    - **CPU Utilization:** How much time the CPU spends actively working. Optimal utilization means no wasted CPU cycles.
    - **Memory Utilization:** How well the OS manages memory. Metrics include available memory, page faults, and overall memory usage.
- **I/O Handling**
    - **Disk I/O Performance:** How fast the OS reads/writes data to disk. Key metrics include throughput, latency, and how well it handles queues.
    - **Network Performance:** Efficiency of network communication, measured by throughput, network latency, and packet loss statistics.
- **Overhead Management**
    - **Context Switching Overhead:** The resources and time needed to switch between processes or threads. Minimizing this overhead is important for efficiency.
    - **Interrupt Handling Time:** How quickly the OS responds to hardware interrupts. Fast interrupt handling is essential for responsiveness.
    - **System Calls Overhead:** The cost (in time and resources) of applications making system calls to access OS services.
- **Resource Optimization**
    - **Load Balancing:** How well the OS spreads work across processing cores for maximum efficiency and minimal bottlenecks.
- **Stability**
    - **Fault Tolerance and Reliability:** The OS's capacity to handle errors and crashes, minimizing downtime and data loss.
- **Eco-Friendliness**
    - **Power Efficiency:** Ability to reduce power usage during idle periods or low workloads.
