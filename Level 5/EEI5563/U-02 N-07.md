### Averaging Metrics

## Arithmetic Mean

The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">sum of values in a dataset divided by the number of values.</mark> It <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">represents the "central" value in a dataset where all values carry equal weight.</mark>

$$
AM = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i 
$$
**Example:** Consider the dataset {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}.

$$
AM = \frac{1}{5} (10 + 20 + 30 + 40 +50) = 30
$$
**Applications:**

- Averaging execution times across multiple benchmark runs.
- Calculating average performance metrics when variations in individual measurements are not a primary concern.
## Geometric Mean (GM)

The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">nth root of the product of values in a dataset.</mark> It is <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">sensitive to large variations in individual values</mark>, making it ideal for analyzing proportional growth or reduction rates.

$$
GM = \sqrt[n]{\prod_{i=1}^{n} x_i}
$$
**Example:** Consider the dataset: {2, 4, 8, 16, 32}.

$$
GM = \sqrt[5]{2 * 4 * 8 * 16 * 32} \approx 8
$$
**Applications:**

- Calculating average speedup in parallel computing (emphasizes multiplicative improvements).
- Analyzing performance improvements across multiple factors where proportional changes are significant.

## Harmonic Mean (HM)

The<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;"> reciprocal of the arithmetic mean of the reciprocals of values in a dataset.</mark> Useful when dealing with rates or ratios where the average rate plays a key role.

$$
HM = \frac{n}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{x_i}}
$$
**Example:** Consider the dataset {2, 4, 8}.

$$
HM = \frac{3}{\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} +\frac{1}{8}} \approx 3.43
$$
**Applications:**

- Averaging performance metrics expressed as rates (e.g., execution time, throughput).
- Analyzing scenarios where the average rate of processing multiple workloads is important.
