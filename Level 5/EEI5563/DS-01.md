# Computer Level Hierarchy

| Level                         | Description                                                                       |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Level 0 - Digital Logic       | Physical components (circuits, gates, wires)                                      |
| Level 1 - Control Unit        | Circuitry controlling information flow and coordinating processor activities      |
| Level 2 - Machine Code        | Set of instructions directly usable by the CPU                                    |
| Level 3 - System Software     | Collection of programs providing instructions for the computer (operating system) |
| Level 4 - Assembly Language   | Approximates machine code using symbols for a specific machine                    |
| Level 5 - High-Level Language | Language designed to resemble user requirements, translated before running        |
| Level 6 - User                | Person for whom hardware/software is designed (developers, installers, servicers) |
The computer hierarchy can be broken down into six levels, from the lowest level of physical components to the highest level of the user. Each level builds on the level below it, providing a more complex and abstract layer of functionality.

- **Level 0: Digital Logic** This is the foundation of the computer hierarchy, consisting of the physical components that make up the computer's circuits. These components, such as gates and wires, manipulate electrical signals to perform calculations and store data.
    
- **Level 1: Control Unit** The control unit is the brain of the computer's central processing unit (CPU). It fetches instructions from memory, decodes them, and directs other parts of the CPU to carry out those instructions.
    
- **Level 2: Machine Code** Machine code is the lowest-level programming language that a computer can understand directly. It is a set of binary instructions that the CPU can execute without any translation.
    
- **Level 3: System Software** System software is a collection of programs that provides the foundation for running other programs on a computer. The operating system is the most important piece of system software. It manages the computer's resources, such as memory, storage, and processors, and provides a platform for running applications.
    
- **Level 4: Assembly Language** Assembly language is a low-level programming language that is easier for humans to read and write than machine code. It uses mnemonics (symbolic abbreviations) to represent machine code instructions. However, assembly language programs still need to be translated into machine code before the computer can execute them.
    
- **Level 5: High-Level Language** High-level languages are programming languages that are designed to be more human-readable and easier to use than assembly language. They are not directly understood by the computer and need to be translated into machine code by a compiler or interpreter before they can be executed.
    
- **Level 6: User** The user is the person who interacts with the computer system. Users can be programmers, system administrators, or anyone who uses a computer for any purpose.

# Von Neumann Architecture

**Key Points**

- **Origin:** Designed by John von Neumann, this model forms the basis for most modern computers.
- **Core Concept:** Stores instructions and data in the same memory, allowing the CPU to access both.
- **Hardware Components:**
    - CPU: Contains the Control Unit (manages instruction flow), ALU (performs calculations), and registers (temporary data storage).
    - Memory: Stores both data and programs.
    - I/O System: Handles input, output, and secondary storage (like hard drives).

**Operation**

- Instructions are executed sequentially (unless specifically altered).
- Data and instructions share a single pathway (bus) between the CPU, memory, and I/O.

**Bottleneck**

- The single pathway can limit processing speed, referred to as the "von Neumann bottleneck".

**Variations**

- **Harvard Architecture:** Separates data and instruction pathways for potentially improved performance.
- **System Bus Architecture:** Employs distinct buses for CPU-memory and memory-I/O communication, which is common in modern systems.

# Fetch and Execute Cycle

The fetch-execute cycle, also known as the instruction cycle, is the fundamental <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">process by which a computer's central processing unit (CPU) executes programs.</mark> It's a continuous loop that ensures instructions are retrieved, understood, and acted upon. Here's a breakdown of the stages involved:

1. **Fetch:**
    
    - The CPU retrieves an instruction from the main memory (RAM). This instruction specifies the operation the CPU needs to perform.
    - The control unit within the CPU pinpoints the memory location of the next instruction based on the program counter (a register keeping track of the instruction to be fetched).
    - The instruction is then fetched from memory and loaded into a register in the CPU.
2. **Decode:**
    
    - The control unit decodes the fetched instruction. This involves interpreting the instruction and determining what operation needs to be carried out (e.g., addition, subtraction, data transfer).
    - The control unit breaks down the instruction into its component parts, such as the operation code (opcode) specifying the action and any operands (data) required for the operation.
3. **Execute:**
    
    - Based on the decoded instruction, the control unit directs the relevant parts of the CPU to execute the operation.
    - This may involve the ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) performing calculations, data being moved between registers, or interacting with memory or I/O devices.

# Flynn's Taxonomy 

- **Purpose:** A method to classify computer architectures based on how they handle instruction and data streams.
- **Proposed:** By Michael Flynn in 1966.
- **Key Concept:** A "stream" represents a sequence of instructions or data.

**Flynn's Four Main Categories:**

1. **SISD (Single Instruction, Single Data):**
    
    - Handles one instruction at a time, operating on a single piece of data.
    - Classic 'traditional' computer model.
2. **SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data):**
    
    - One instruction applied simultaneously to multiple data elements.
    - Useful for tasks like vector or array processing.
3. **MISD (Multiple Instruction, Single Data):**
    
    - Multiple instructions operate on a single data stream.
    - Less common, specialized use cases (e.g., redundant systems for fault tolerance).
4. **MIMD (Multiple Instruction, Multiple Data):**
    
    - Multiple instructions operate on multiple data streams concurrently.
    - Most modern multi-core processors and parallel systems fall into this category.

# Parallel Computing

Parallel computing is all about splitting large problems into smaller, independent chunks that can be solved simultaneously by multiple processors or computers. It's the concept of "many hands make light work".

**Types of Parallelism**

- **Data Parallelism:** The same operation is performed on different parts of a large dataset simultaneously. (Example: applying a filter across all pixels in an image)
- **Task Parallelism:** Different, independent tasks are processed in parallel. (Example: one processor working on image processing while another handles audio decoding.)

**Challenges**

- **Algorithmic Design:** Not all problems are easily broken into parallelizable tasks.
- **Coordination and Overhead:** Managing communication and synchronization between processors adds complexity.

# Performance Comparison at Execution Time

- **Key Metric:** Execution Time – the time it takes the machine to run the program. Shorter time = faster machine for that program.
- **Performance Formula:** Performance = 1 / Execution Time

**Factors Affecting Execution Time (and therefore Performance)**

- **Instruction Count:** The total number of instructions the program contains.
- **Cycles Per Instruction (CPI):** How many clock cycles each instruction takes on average.
- **Clock Cycle Time:** The duration of a single clock cycle (determined by clock speed).

**Comparing Machines**

- **Relative Performance:** If Machine A executes the program in 5 seconds and Machine B in 10 seconds:
    - Performance(A) / Performance(B) = 2.
    - Machine A is twice as fast as Machine B for this specific program.

**The CPU Equation**

- **Purpose:** Calculates the time a CPU takes to execute a specific program.
- **Formula:** CPU Time = Instructions x CPI x Clock Cycle Time
    - **Instructions:** Total number of instructions in the program.
    - **CPI (Cycles Per Instruction):** Average number of clock cycles needed to execute a single instruction.
    - **Clock Cycle Time:** The time for one clock cycle (inverse of clock rate).

**Factors Affecting CPU Time**

- **Reducing Instruction Count:** Efficient code uses fewer instructions, improving execution time.
- **Lowering CPI:** Optimized processor design can execute instructions in fewer cycles.
- **Increasing Clock Rate:** A faster clock (shorter cycle time) speeds up execution.

**Example Notes**

- **Given:**
    - Instruction Count: 10,000,000
    - CPI: 2.5
    - Clock Rate: 200 MHz (Note: Clock cycle time is 1/Clock Rate)
- **Calculation:**
    - CPU Time = 10,000,000 * 2.5 * (1/200,000,000) = 0.125 seconds
