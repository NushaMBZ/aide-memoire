# Software Varification and Validation
## Verification and Validation

### Verification
The process of ensuring that the implemented software <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">meets specified requirments and adheres to the quality standards.</mark>

### Validationresearch a
The process of assuring that the <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">product meets it's requirements by the user.</mark>

### Difference between V&V

| Category  | Verification                                         | Validation                                          |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Objective | meeting the specified requirmetns                    | meets the intended user needs and requirments       |
| Focus     | focuses on the development process                   | focuses on final product and it's suitability       |

## Unit Testing
The process of evaluating single function or componenet of a program.
## Static Testing
Testing performed without executing the systemâ€™s code.(It can be manual or automated)
## Quality Control
The process by which product ==quality is compared with applicable standards, and the action taken when there is a deviance.== 
## Quality Assurance
Set support activities that ==provide adequate confidence that the quality testing processes are established== and continuously improved to produce high quality product.
## Cost of Quality
Cost of Quality is the cost incurred in addition the production cost of a product to improve it's quality.
### Types Cost In Quality
#### prevention costs
Expenses incurred to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">prevent defects and quality issues</mark> from occurring in the first place.
- Investments in development of SQA components
- Implementation of SQA preventive activities.
- Control of the SQA system through performance.
#### appraisal costs
Costs related to the process of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">assessing and evaluating the quality of products</mark> or services.
- Cost of reviews
- Cost of software testing
- Cost of assurance quality of external participants
#### internal failure cost
Costs that arise from <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">defects or quality issues discovered within the organization </mark>before the product reaches the customer.
- Cost of redesign or design corrections subsequent
- Cost of re-programming or correcting programs
- Cost of repeated design review
#### external failure cost
Costs incurred when <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">defects or quality problems are discovered by customers after the product or service has been delivered.</mark>
 

## Defect
A defect is a product requirement that has not been met.

## Views on Quality

### Transcendental View
In this view quality is considered as ==absolute and recognizable trait of that can be learned through experience.==
### Product View
Quality is considered as a ==variable based on the attribute possessed by the product.==
### User View
In this view, quality of a product is determined by the ==experience and satisfaction of the user.==
### Manufacturer View
This view considers the process of producing a product and ==assesses to what degree the product is developed "right" ==the first time.
### Value Based View
If a product is perceived to be ==offering good value== for the price, it possesses good quality.

## Test Objective
The statement that defines what the ==test team or tester is expected to accomplish during a specific testing activity== is typically known as the "test objective" or "testing objective."

## Exhaustive Testing
Exhaustive testing, also known as complete testing or brute force testing, is a theoretical concept in software testing that involves ==testing all possible combinations of inputs and conditions to ensure that every possible scenario and outcome is covered.==
