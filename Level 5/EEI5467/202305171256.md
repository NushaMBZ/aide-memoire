# Cyclomatic Complexity
Software metric that <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">quantifies the complexity of a program by measuring the number of independent paths</mark> through its source code.

-   M represents the cyclomatic complexity.
-   E is the number of edges in the control flow graph.
-   N is the number of nodes in the control flow graph.
-   P is the number of connected components (the number of regions).

$$
M=E-N+2P

## Importance of Cyclomatic Complexity
- Code quality: Cyclomatic complexity serves as an <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">indicator of code quality.</mark>
- Maintainability: Code with low cyclomatic complexity is <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">easier to maintain and modify</mark>.
- Defect density: Research has shown a correlation between <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">higher cyclomatic complexity and a greater likelihood of defects.</mark>
- Maintainability index: Cyclomatic complexity is one of the factors used to calculate the Maintainability Index (MI), which provides a numeric measure of the maintainability of a software system.
