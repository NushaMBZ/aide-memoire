> [!question]
> State the scope of macroeconomics? How does it differ from microeconomics?

Macroeconomic aspect tries to capture the behavior (national income, general price level, distribution, employment, money) of a given economy as a whole in a given period of time. It varies from microeconomics for the following reasons.
- Unlike microeconomics, macroeconomics doesn't necessarily focus on individual economic agents or their interaction with the environment.
- In microeconomics, all macroeconomic variables are constant while in macroeconomics, all micro-economic variables are constant.

> [!question]
> Identify and discuss the key macroeconomic issues related to IT sector in Sri Lanka

One key macroeconmic issue could be the concept of <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">brain-drain</mark>, during the past couple of years sri Lanka experienced a net outflow of skilled labor, which represents a loss of valuable human capital. 

Another one we could talk about is the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">stability of the economy</mark>, specifically in terms of exchange rate. Drastic fluctuations in ER can create uncertainty for IT firms engaged in international trade.

Just as any other sector, IT sector is sensitive to <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">inflation</mark>, because it affects the purchasing power of consumers and input costs for firms.

> Download GDP data of Sri Lanka from the Central Bank web site from 2013 to 2022
and answer the following questions based on the data downloaded

> [!question]
> What was the growth rate of nominal GDP between 2013 and 2022?

```
Nominal GDP = Real GDP * GDP Deflator
```

Real GDP in 2022 : -7.8%
GDP Deflator in 2022 : 48.8%

```
Nominal GDP in 2022 = -7.8% * 48.8% = -3.81%
```

Real GDP in 2013 : 6.3%
GDP Deflator in 2013 : 8.9%

```
Nominal GDP in 2013 = 6.3% * 8.9% = 0.56%
```

```
Growth rate = (Nominal GDP in 2022 - Nominal GDP in 2013) / Nominal GDP in 2013 * 100
```

```
Growth rate = (-38.1% - 0.56%) / 0.56% * 100 = -778.87%
```

> [!question]
> What was the growth rate of the GDP deflator (inflation) between 2013 and 2022?

```
Inflation rate = (GDP deflator in year 2 - GDP deflator in year 1) / GDP deflator in year 1 * 100
```

```
Inflation rate = (48.8% - 8.9%) / 8.9% * 100 = 448.31%
```

> [!question]
> What was the real GDP in 2013 measured in 2022 prices?

```
Real GDP in 2013 measured in 2022 prices = 6.3% * (48.8% / 8.9%) = 35.34%
```

> [!question]
> What was the real GDP in 2022 measured in 2013 prices?

```
Real GDP in 2022 measured in 2013 prices = -7.8% * (8.9% / 48.8%) = -1.64%
```

> [!question]
> Why does growth rate of nominal GDP different from that of real GDP? Explain.

The growth rate of nominal GDP is different from that of real GDP because nominal GDP<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;"> measures the value of goods and services produced in an economy at current market prices,</mark> while <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">real GDP measures the value of goods and services produced in an economy at constant prices.</mark>

> [!question]
> Do you see any relationship? Explain Okun’s law with these data?

The Sri Lanka data shows that when GDP growth is high, the unemployment rate tends to fall. This negative relationship between GDP growth and unemployment is due to the fact that economic growth creates new jobs. When businesses are expanding and investing, they hire more workers. This drives down the unemployment rate. Conversely, when economic growth is slow or negative, businesses may lay off workers. This drives up the unemployment rate.


> [!question]
> Describe patterns and trends of inflation using CCPI and NCPI for the last 5 years (2018 to 2022). Use the data from Central Bank Annual reports. 

1. **2018 to 2019:**
   
    - In 2018, both CCPI and NCPI saw relatively low inflation rates, with Y-o-Y headline inflation hovering around 3% to 4%. Core inflation was slightly lower.
    - In 2019, inflation gradually picked up, reaching around 5% to 6% by the end of the year for both indices.
2. **2020:**
   
    - In 2020, inflation rates in Sri Lanka experienced significant fluctuations. At the beginning of the year, inflation was around 5% for both indices.
    - However, as the year progressed, inflation started to increase, especially in the NCPI, which reached around 8% by mid-year.
    - These inflation spikes were partly driven by the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
3. **2021:**
    
    - Inflation accelerated significantly in 2021. Both CCPI and NCPI saw Y-o-Y headline inflation rates exceeding 10% by mid-year.
    - Core inflation also increased but remained slightly lower than headline inflation, indicating that some of the inflation was driven by factors like food and energy prices.
4. **2022:**
    
    - Inflation continued to rise in 2022, reaching very high levels by the middle of the year.
    - The Y-o-Y headline inflation rate exceeded 60% for both CCPI and NCPI, indicating a severe inflationary period.
    - Core inflation also surged but was somewhat lower than headline inflation, suggesting that some of the inflationary pressures may have been due to temporary factors.
