> [!question]
> State the scope of macroeconomics? How does it differ from microeconomics?


Macroeconomic aspect tries to capture the behavior (national income, general price level, distribution, employment, money) of a given economy as a whole in a given period of time. It varies from microeconomics for the following reasons.
- Unlike microeconomics, macroeconomics doesn't necessarily focus on individual economic agents or their interaction with the environment.
- In microeconomics, all macroeconomic variables are constant while in macroeconomics, all micro-economic variables are constant.

> [!question]
> Identify and discuss the key macroeconomic issues related to IT sector in Sri Lanka

One key macroeconmic issue could be the concept of <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">brain-drain</mark>, during the past couple of years sri Lanka experienced a net outflow of skilled labor, which represents a loss of valuable human capital. 

Another one we could talk about is the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">stability of the economy</mark>, specifically in terms of exchange rate. Drastic fluctuations in ER can create uncertainty for IT firms engaged in international trade.

Just as any other sector, IT sector can be sensitive to <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">inflation</mark>, because it affects the purchasing power of consumers and input costs for firms. 


> [!note]
> Download GDP data of Sri Lanka from the Central Bank web site from 2013 to 2022
and answer the following questions based on the data downloaded

> [!question]
> What was the growth rate of nominal GDP between 2013 and 2022?

> [!tip]
> GDP Deflator = $$\frac{Nominal GDP}{Real GDP}\times100$$

$$
\frac{\text{GDP Deflator}}{100}=\frac{\text{Nominal GDP}}{\text{Real GDP}}
$$
$$
\frac{\text{GDP Deflator}}{100}\times \text{Real GDP}=\frac{\text{Nominal GDP}}{\text{Real GDP}}\times \text{Real GDP}
$$


## 2022
Change in Real GDP Growth Rate  : -7.8%
Change in GDP Deflator : 48.8%

Thus Change in Nominal GDP Growth Rate :
$$
\frac{48.8}{100}\times -7.8\%=-3.80\%
$$


## 2021
Real GDP Growth Rate : 3.5%

GDP Deflator 2021 : 8.5%

Thus Change in Nominal GDP Growth Rate :
$$
\frac{3.5}{100}\times 8.5\%=0.29\% 
$$

## 2020
Real GDP Growth Rate : -4.6

GDP Deflator 2020 : 3.3%

Thus Change in Nominal GDP Growth Rate : 
$$
\frac{3.3}{100}\times -4.6\%=-0.15\%
$$
## 2019
Real GDP Growth Rate : -0.2

GDP Deflator 2019 : 3.9%

Thus Change in Nominal GDP Growth Rate :
$$
\frac{3.9\%}{100}\times-0.2=-0.007%
$$
## 2018
Real GDP Growth Rate : 2.3

GDP Deflator 2018 : 4.3%

Thus Change in Nominal GDP Growth Rate : 
$$
\frac{4.3}{100}\times2.3=0.09\%
$$
## 2017
Real GDP Growth Rate : 6.5

GDP Deflator 2017 : 5.5%

Thus Change in Nominal GDP Growth Rate :
$$
\frac{5.5}{100}\times6.5=0.35\%
$$
## 2016
Real GDP Growth Rate : 5.1

GDP Deflator 2016 : 5.4%

Thus Change in Nominal GDP Growth Rate : 

 5.4 / 100 * 5.1 = 0.27%


2015
Real GDP Growth Rate : 4.8

GDP Deflator 2015 : 0.8%

Thus Change in Nominal GDP Growth Rate :

 0.8 / 100 * 4.8 = 0.03%



2014
Real GDP Growth Rate : 5.0

GDP Deflator 2014 : 2.9%

Thus Change in Nominal GDP Growth Rate :

 2.9 / 100 * 5.0 = 0.14%


2013
Real GDP Growth Rate : 3.4

GDP Deflator 2013 : 6.2%

Thus Change in Nominal GDP Growth Rate :

 6.2 / 100 * 3.4 = 0.21%


2012
Real GDP Growth Rate : 9.1

GDP Deflator 2012 : 10.8%

Thus Change in Nominal GDP Growth Rate :

 10.8 / 100 * 9.1 = 0.98%
