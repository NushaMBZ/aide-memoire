# Markets and Social Welfare  

## Welfare economics  
This is the study of ‘<mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">how the allocation of resources affects economic wellbeing</mark>’.

## Consumer Surplus
It is the *difference* between the  <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">maximum amount a consumer is willing to pay for a good and the actual amount a  consumer has to pay for the good. </mark>

## Producer Surplus
The *difference* between the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">amount a seller is paid for his good or a service and the cost of production gives the ‘producer  surplus’.</mark>

## Market Efficiency
Market efficiency refers to the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">effectiveness with which resources are allocated in a market to maximize overall economic welfare.</mark>

## Cost of Taxation

> Governments use tax, subsidies and  price controls as tools for correcting market failures.

Negative economic effects and efficiency losses that taxes can impose on an economy. A tax can be charged on a seller or a consumer for producing or consuming a good. 

> [!note]
> If the tax is on  consumers, the demand curve <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">shifts left since it is a price increase for the consumers</mark>. If  the tax is on producers, the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">supply curve shifts left since it is an increase in cost of  production</mark> for them.

# Market Failure

This is when the<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> allocation of goods and services by a free market is inefficient</mark> and <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">results in outcomes that are not optimal for society.</mark>

Markets may require government involvement when they fail to efficiently allocate resources or when certain conditions arise that hinder the proper functioning of markets.

1. **Market Failures:**
    
    - **Monopoly or Oligopoly:** When a single firm or a small group of firms <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">have substantial market power</mark>, they can set prices higher than competitive levels, leading to reduced consumer welfare. Governments may regulate such markets to prevent abuse of market power.
      
    - **Externalities:** When the actions of buyers or sellers <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">have unintended effects on third parties </mark>(positive externalities like education or negative externalities like pollution), markets might not account for these effects. Governments can step in to internalize externalities through taxes, subsidies, or regulations.
      
    - **Public Goods:** Markets often <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">underprovide public goods</mark> (e.g., national defense, clean air) because they are non-excludable and non-rivalrous. Governments may finance and provide public goods to ensure their availability.
      
    - **Information Asymmetry:** When one party <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">has more information than the other</mark>, as in the case of lemons in the used car market, markets can break down. Regulations, disclosure requirements, and consumer protection laws can address this issue.
      
2. **Promoting Fair Competition:**
    
    - **Antitrust Regulation:** Governments may intervene to <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">prevent anticompetitive behavior</mark>, such as collusion, price fixing, or abuse of dominant market positions, in order to maintain fair competition and prevent market distortions.
      
3. **Stabilizing the Economy:**
    
    - **Monetary and Fiscal Policy:** Governments use monetary policy (e.g., interest rate adjustments) and fiscal policy (e.g., government spending, taxation) to stabilize the economy during economic downturns or inflationary pressures.
      
4. **Income Redistribution:**
    
    - **Social Welfare Programs:** Governments can implement social welfare programs, like unemployment benefits, food assistance, and housing support, to redistribute income and provide a safety net for those in need.
      
5. **Ensuring Consumer Protection:**
    
    - **Product and Service Standards:** Governments may regulate industries to ensure products and services meet certain safety, quality, and ethical standards, protecting consumers from harm.
      
6. **Addressing Market Imperfections:**
    
    - **Labor Market Regulation:** Governments may set labor standards (minimum wage, working hours) and enforce employment laws to protect workers' rights and prevent exploitation.
      
7. **Promoting Long-Term Interests:**
    
    - **Environmental Regulation:** Governments may regulate industries to reduce pollution and environmental degradation, safeguarding long-term ecological sustainability.
      
8. **Crisis Management:**
    
    - **Financial Crises:** Governments might intervene in financial markets during crises to prevent systemic collapse and maintain stability.
      
9. **Ensuring Access to Essential Services:**
    
    - **Healthcare and Education:** In cases where markets may not ensure equitable access to essential services, governments might provide or regulate these services to ensure universal access.

# Dead weight loss

A deadweight loss is **a cost to society created by market inefficiency, which occurs when supply and demand are out of equilibrium**.
