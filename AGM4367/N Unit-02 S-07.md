# Markets and Social Welfare  

## Welfare economics  
This is the study of ‘<mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">how the allocation of resources affects economic wellbeing</mark>’.

## Consumer Surplus
It is the *difference* between the  <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">maximum amount a consumer is willing to pay for a good and the actual amount a  consumer has to pay for the good. </mark>

## Producer Surplus
The *difference* between the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">amount a seller is paid for his good or a service and the cost of production gives the ‘producer  surplus’.</mark>

## Market Efficiency
Market efficiency refers to the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">effectiveness with which resources are allocated in a market to maximize overall economic welfare.</mark>

## Cost of Taxation

> Governments use tax, subsidies and  price controls as tools for correcting market failures.

Negative economic effects and efficiency losses that taxes can impose on an economy. A tax can be charged on a seller or a consumer for producing or consuming a good. 

> [!note]
> If the tax is on  consumers, the demand curve <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">shifts left since it is a price increase for the consumers</mark>. If  the tax is on producers, the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">supply curve shifts left since it is an increase in cost of  production</mark> for them.

# Market Failure

This is when the allocation of goods and services by a free market is inefficient and results in outcomes that are not optimal for society.

# Dead weight loss

A deadweight loss is **a cost to society created by market inefficiency, which occurs when supply and demand are out of equilibrium**.
