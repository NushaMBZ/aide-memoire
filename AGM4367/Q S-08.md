> What is a binding price floor and non-binding price floor?

1. Binding Price Floor:
    
    - A binding price floor is set above the equilibrium price, which is the price at which the quantity of a good supplied equals the quantity demanded in a free market.
    - When a price floor is binding, it has real economic consequences because it creates a situation where the price that the government mandates (the floor price) is higher than the price that would naturally occur in a free market.
    - The result is that there is an excess supply or surplus of the good at the higher price, as producers are willing to supply more of the product than consumers are willing to buy at that price. This can lead to an accumulation of unsold goods.
2. Non-binding Price Floor:
    
    - A non-binding price floor is set below the equilibrium price or at a level where it has no impact on the market because it's lower than the prevailing market price.
    - In this case, the market price is already higher than the government-mandated price floor, so the floor has no effect on market outcomes.
    - Producers can continue to sell their goods at the market price without any interference from the price floor.

**Minimum Wage:** Governments establish a legally mandated minimum hourly wage that employers must pay to their workers.

**Agricultural Price Supports:** Governments in many countries establish price floors for agricultural products like wheat, corn, and rice.

**Rent Control:** In some urban areas, rent control laws set maximum rental prices that landlords can charge for residential properties.

> [!question]
> Give examples for consumer tax and producer tax

Consumer taxes and producer taxes are forms of taxation that can affect different participants in a market—consumers and producers—differently. Here are examples of each:

**Consumer Tax (also known as a sales tax or excise tax):**

1. **Sales Tax:** A common example of a consumer tax is a sales tax, which is applied to the sale of goods and services. 
    
2. **Value Added Tax (VAT):** In many countries, a value-added tax is applied to the price of goods and services at various stages of production and distribution.
    
3. **Sin Taxes:** These are taxes specifically imposed on products that are considered harmful or undesirable, such as alcohol, tobacco, and sugary beverages.
    

**Producer Tax (also known as an excise tax or production tax):**

1. **Excise Taxes on Gasoline:** Governments often impose excise taxes on gasoline producers or importers. These taxes are built into the price of gasoline and are ultimately paid by consumers. 
    
2. **Alcohol Production Tax:** Producers of alcoholic beverages may be subject to excise taxes on their products. 
    
3. **Airline Ticket Tax:** In some countries, airlines are subject to taxes on each ticket sold. 
    
4. **Carbon Taxes:** Some governments impose taxes on producers based on the carbon emissions associated with their production processes.

> The impact of a tax among its participants (consumers and producers) does not depend on from whom the tax is collected by the government. In other words, legal tax incidence is irrelevant for the economic tax incidence.
