 > [!question]
 > Give some examples for price discrimination

1. **Tiered Pricing**: Companies often offer tiered pricing plans based on the features or quantity of a product or service. For example, a software company may offer a basic plan at a lower price point and a premium plan with more features at a higher price.
    
2. **Student or Senior Discounts**: Businesses like movie theaters, public transportation, and restaurants may offer discounts to students or senior citizens, charging them less than the standard adult rate.
    
3. **Coupon Codes**: Retailers provide coupon codes that can be applied at checkout, allowing customers to pay a lower price for a product. These codes are often distributed to specific customer segments.

> [!question]
> If the cost of software developer increased to Rs.3 million, how does it affect the firm’s decision?

1. **Increase in Total Cost**: The cost of acquiring the copyrights was initially Rs. 2 million. With the increased cost of the software developer to Rs. 3 million, the total cost of developing and acquiring the copyrights for the software will now be Rs. 3 million (developer cost) + Rs. 10,000 (marginal cost per transaction) = Rs. 3,010,000.
    
2. **Profitability**: The firm's profitability will be affected by this cost increase.
    
3. **Pricing Strategy**: The firm may need to adjust its pricing strategy for the software.
    
4. **Demand and Sales**: The increase in the software's price may potentially affect the demand for the product.
