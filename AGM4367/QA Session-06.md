Assume the price elasticity of demand for natural gas is 0.3 in the short run and  0.8 in the long run.   

If the price of a gallon rises from Rs. 800 to 1,200, what happens to the quantity  demanded in short run and long run? Use the midpoint method.  
$$
\text{Percentage Change = }\frac{((\text{New Value - Old Value})} {((\text{New Value + Old Value}) / 2))} * 100%
$$
Initial price (Old Value) = Rs. 800 
New price (New Value) = Rs. 1,200

Percentage Change in Price 
$$
\begin{align}
= ((1,200 - 800) / ((1,200 + 800) / 2)) * 100% \\
= (400 / 1,000) * 100% \\
= 40% \\
\end{align}
$$

Short-run price elasticity of demand = 0.3 
Long-run price elasticity of demand = 0.8

**For the short run:**

Percentage Change in Quantity Demanded (Short Run) = 0.3 * 40% = 12%

**For the long run:**

Percentage Change in Quantity Demanded (Long Run) = 0.8 * 40% = 32%

Change in Quantity Demanded (Short Run) = 12% of Q 

Change in Quantity Demanded (Long Run) = 32% of Q
