# Externalities
An externality is the impact of one party's economic activities on another party's well-being that is not considered in the market price. In other words, it is the cost or benefit that arises from an economic activity that falls on a third party.

**Positive externalities** occur when the production or consumption of a good or service benefits a third party. This means that the benefits of the good or service extend beyond the person who produces or consumes it.

**Negative externalities** occur when the production or consumption of a good or service harms a third party. This means that the costs of the good or service extend beyond the person who produces or consumes it.

> Internalizing an externality is the process of making the producer or consumer of a good or service bear the full costs of that good or service, including both the private costs and the external costs. This can be done through a variety of policies, such as taxes, subsidies, or regulations.


## Externalities in Production
A production process involves activities that influence the wellbeing of bystanders.  Those are called production externalities. These can cause positive or negative impacts  on bystanders.

**Positive externalities of production**

- **Education:** When a person gets an education, they are not only benefiting themselves, but they are also benefiting society as a whole. Educated people are more likely to be productive workers, and they are also more likely to be civically engaged.
- **Vaccination:** When a person gets vaccinated against a disease, they are not only protecting themselves from the disease, but they are also helping to protect others who are not vaccinated. This is because vaccinated people are less likely to spread the disease to others.
- **Research and development:** When a company invests in research and development, they are not only developing new products and services, but they are also contributing to the overall knowledge base of society. This can lead to new inventions and innovations that benefit everyone.
- **Farming:** When farmers use sustainable practices, they can help to improve the environment and reduce pollution. This can benefit both farmers and the surrounding community.
- **Reforestation:** When trees are planted, they can help to improve air quality and reduce flooding. This can benefit both the environment and the people who live nearby.

**Negative externalities of production**

- **Pollution:** When a factory pollutes the air or water, it harms the health of people who live nearby. It can also damage ecosystems and reduce property values.
- **Noise pollution:** When a noisy factory or airport is located near homes or businesses, it can make it difficult for people to sleep, concentrate, and enjoy their lives.
- **Land use:** When a factory or other development takes up land, it can prevent others from using that land for other purposes, such as agriculture or recreation.
- **Resource depletion:** When a company depletes a natural resource, such as oil or water, it can harm future generations who will need to rely on that resource.

## Externalities in Consumption
Sometimes consumption activities of individuals create externalities on bystanders.  Those are called externalities in consumption.

- **Negative externalities:**
    
    - **Congestion:** When people drive cars, they contribute to traffic congestion. This can lead to delays, pollution, and accidents.
    - **Noise pollution:** When people play loud music or use noisy machinery, they can disturb their neighbors.
    - **Littering:** When people litter, they create unsightly and unhealthy conditions.
    - **Social ills:** When people consume drugs or alcohol, they can harm themselves and others.
    - **Obesity:** When people eat unhealthy foods, they can increase their risk of developing health problems, such as heart disease and diabetes.
- **Positive externalities:**
    
    - **Education:** When people get an education, they are not only benefiting themselves, but they are also benefiting society as a whole. Educated people are more likely to be productive workers, and they are also more likely to be civically engaged.
    - **Vaccination:** When people get vaccinated against a disease, they are not only protecting themselves from the disease, but they are also helping to protect others who are not vaccinated. This is because vaccinated people are less likely to spread the disease to others.
    - **Socializing:** When people socialize, they can build relationships and strengthen their communities. This can have a positive impact on mental and physical health.
    - **Volunteering:** When people volunteer, they are helping others and making a difference in their community. This can have a positive impact on their own sense of well-being.
    - **Organ donation:** When people donate organs, they are saving lives. This is a positive externality because the benefits of organ donation extend beyond the donor to the recipient and their family.

## Social marginal cost and private marginal cost in production  

The social marginal cost (SMC) of production is the total cost of producing a good or service, including both <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">the private marginal cost (PMC) and the external marginal cost (EMC)</mark>. The PMC is the cost that is borne by the producer, while the EMC is the cost that is <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">borne by third parties</mark>, such as the environment or other people.

The <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">SMC is higher than the PMC when there are negative externalities</mark> associated with production. For example, when a factory pollutes the air, the EMC is the cost of the pollution, such as the health problems that it causes. The SMC includes the PMC and the EMC, so it is higher than the PMC.

The difference between the SMC and the PMC is called the marginal external cost (MEC). The MEC is the cost that is imposed on third parties by the production of a good or service.

In the absence of government intervention, the market equilibrium is reached where the PMC is equal to the market price. However, because the SMC is higher than the PMC, the market equilibrium is inefficient. This is because the market price does not reflect the full social cost of production. As a result, too much of the good or service is produced.

## Social marginal cost and private marginal cost in consumption
The social marginal cost (SMC) and private marginal cost (PMC) are two different concepts that are used to measure the cost of consuming a good or service. The SMC is the total cost of consuming the good or service, including both the private cost and the external cost. The PMC is the cost that is borne by the consumer.

The private marginal cost is the additional cost that is incurred by the consumer when one more unit of the good or service is consumed. For example, the private marginal cost of consuming a pizza is the price that the consumer pays for the pizza.

The social marginal cost is the additional cost that is incurred by society when one more unit of the good or service is consumed. The social marginal cost includes the private marginal cost, as well as any external costs that are imposed on third parties. For example, the social marginal cost of consuming a pizza includes the price of the pizza, as well as the cost of the pollution that is created when the pizza is produced.

In the case of a positive externality in consumption, the SMC is less than the PMC. This is because the external benefit is not taken into account by the consumer.

## Government Policies
Government policy refers to the actions that a government takes to address the negative or positive externalities that are created by market activities.

### Economic Instruments
Economic instruments are policy tools that use market forces to achieve a desired outcome. They are often used to address externalities, which are costs or benefits that are not reflected in the price of a good or service.

For example, a tax on gasoline is an economic instrument that can be used to reduce air pollution. The tax makes gasoline more expensive, which discourages people from driving and reduces the amount of pollution that is created.

Subsidies are another type of economic instrument. They are payments that the government makes to producers or consumers to encourage them to produce or consume a good or service. For example, a subsidy for solar panels can make them more affordable for consumers, which encourages them to buy solar panels and reduce their reliance on fossil fuels.

Economic instruments can be effective in addressing externalities because they work with the market rather than against it. They can also be more efficient than other policy tools, such as regulations, because they allow the market to find the most cost-effective way to achieve the desired outcome.

### Command-and-control (CAC) 
It measures are a type of government policy that is used to regulate the behavior of businesses and individuals. CAC measures are typically used to address negative externalities, which are costs or benefits that are not reflected in the price of a good or service.

For example, a CAC measure could be a regulation that limits the amount of pollution that a factory can emit. This regulation would force the factory to reduce its pollution, even if it would be more profitable for the factory to pollute.

CAC measures are often seen as being less efficient than economic instruments, such as taxes and subsidies. This is because CAC measures do not allow the market to find the most cost-effective way to achieve the desired outcome. However, CAC measures can be more effective in addressing negative externalities that are difficult to measure, such as environmental damage.

### Selecting a pollution control policy  
Pollution is a focal negative externality which is controlled under different policy  instruments. There are three measures to control pollution. 

- **Pigouvian tax:** A Pigouvian tax is a tax that is imposed on a polluter to internalize the external cost of pollution. The tax is set equal to the marginal social cost of pollution, which is the cost of pollution to society as a whole. Pigouvian taxes are considered to be the most efficient way to control pollution because they allow the market to find the most cost-effective way to reduce pollution.
- **Tradable pollution permits:** Tradable pollution permits are a market-based approach to pollution control. The government sets a cap on the total amount of pollution that can be emitted, and then issues permits to polluters. Polluters can then trade these permits with each other. This system allows polluters to find the most cost-effective way to reduce their pollution.
- **Command-and-control regulations:** Command-and-control regulations are government rules that set limits on the amount of pollution that can be emitted. These regulations can be very effective in reducing pollution, but they can also be costly and inflexible.

The choice of policy will depend on the specific circumstances. For example, a Pigouvian tax may be the most efficient way to control pollution in a case where the external cost of pollution is easy to measure. Tradable pollution permits may be the most efficient way to control pollution in a case where the external cost of pollution is difficult to measure. Command-and-control regulations may be the most appropriate way to control pollution in a case where the polluters are unwilling to reduce their pollution voluntarily.

Here are some of the advantages and disadvantages of each policy:

- **Pigouvian tax:**
    - Advantages:
        - Efficient
        - Flexible
        - Can be used to address a variety of externalities
    - Disadvantages:
        - Can be difficult to measure the external cost of pollution
        - Can be unpopular with polluters
- **Tradable pollution permits:**
    - Advantages:
        - Efficient
        - Flexible
        - Can be used to address a variety of externalities
    - Disadvantages:
        - Can be difficult to design the system
        - Can be difficult to monitor and enforce
- **Command-and-control regulations:**
    - Advantages:
        - Can be effective in reducing pollution
        - Simple to understand and implement
    - Disadvantages:
        - Can be inefficient
        - Can be inflexible
        - Can be unpopular with polluters

### Emission standards 
These are limits on the amount of pollution that can be emitted from a source, such as a factory or a car. They are a type of command-and-control regulation that is used to control pollution.

Emission standards can be set for a variety of pollutants, including air pollutants, water pollutants, and noise pollutants. They can be set for specific pollutants, such as sulfur dioxide or nitrogen oxides, or they can be set for general categories of pollutants, such as particulate matter or volatile organic compounds.
