##  Macroeconomic Concepts 

Gross Domestic Product (GDP) -> Typically calculated over a year, the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">total value of goods and services produced</mark> within the borders of a country is measured.

Gross National Product (GNP) ->	A measure of the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">total value of goods and services produced by a country’s citizens,</mark> regardless of their location, over a specified period, typically a year.

Interest Rate -> The <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">cost of borrowing money</mark>, typically expressed as a percentage of the amount borrowed, or the return earned on saving or investing money.

Trade balance -> The <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">discrepancy between the value of goods and services that a country exports and the value of those that it imports</mark> is known as the balance of trade.

National Debt -> The <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">outstanding sum of money that a government owes to its creditors</mark>, which is frequently represented as a percentage of GDP, serves as an indicator of a country’s financial well-being. This is known as the government debt.

Balance of Payments (BoP) -> A <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">record of all economic transactions between a country and the rest of the world </mark>over a specified period, including trade in goods and services, income flows, and capital flows.

Exchange Rate -> The <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">value of one currency in terms of another currency</mark>, often expressed as the amount of one currency required to purchase one unit of the other currency.

Aggregate Demand (AD) -> The <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">total demand for goods and services </mark>in an economy at a given price level, including consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports.

Business cycle -> The <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">recurring pattern of expansion and contraction in economic activity</mark>, typically measured by changes in GDP over time.

## Goals

- **Economic growth:** Economic growth is the increase in the total output of goods and services in an economy over time.
  
- **Price stability:** Price stability refers to a low and stable rate of inflation. 
  
- **Full employment:** Full employment is a situation in which everyone who is able and willing to work can find a job. 
  
- **External balance:** External balance refers to a sustainable balance of payments.

## Policy Instruments

These are tools that policymakers use to achieve macroeconomic goals.

**Fiscal policy** refers to government spending and taxation. 

> [!example]
> If the economy is in a recession, the government can increase spending or cut taxes in order to stimulate economic activity. Conversely, if the economy is overheating, the government can cut spending or raise taxes in order to slow down economic growth.

**Monetary policy** refers to the central bank's control of the money supply and interest rates. 

> [!example]
> If the central bank wants to stimulate economic activity, it can lower interest rates, which will make it cheaper for businesses to borrow money and invest. Conversely, if the central bank wants to slow down economic growth, it can raise interest rates, which will make it more expensive for businesses to borrow money and invest.


## Agents

Macroeconomic agents are the different groups of participants in the economy.

- **Households:** Households are the consumers of goods and services in the economy. They also provide labor to businesses.
  
- **Firms:** Firms are the producers of goods and services in the economy. They hire labor and purchase capital goods from other businesses.
  
- **Government:** The government is the provider of public goods and services, such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure. It also collects taxes and makes transfers to households and businesses.
  
- **Central bank:** The central bank is the institution that controls the money supply and interest rates. It is responsible for maintaining price stability and promoting economic growth.
