What is the difference between social sciences and natural sciences?

* Social sciences deal with studying the human's **behaviour in social context** while natural sciences deal with studying the structures and relationships in natural substances.

How is economics considered a social science?

* Since economics is a study that attempts observe human's behaviour towards scarcity which in a sense is a way of studying human's behaviour in social context or aka social science.

What is the science of choice?

* Science of choice is the term used to describe how people make descions in the event of limited resources with unlimited wants, this is a branch of economics that focuses on the behaviour of individuals and firms.

Why is economics a useful subject to study?

* This discipline helps analyze the behaviour of economic agents in macro and micro level to make better deciosion to allocate resources for the neccassry requirements.

Discuss the concept of economic agents and explain why activities are conducted by them.

* Economic agents are individual units capable of utilizing the scarce resouces to get the best advantage, since the very nature of resources reminds us the fact that they are scare economics agents should engage in the activity of properly utilizing the resource to get what they need.

 Explain the relationship between activities and benefits in the context of economic agents.

* As the agents employ their scarce resources such as land, labout, capital and entereprenurship they happen to have to the chance to enjoy the benefits such as salary, dividents and profits.

What are the costs associated with activities performed by economic agents? How do these costs influence decision-making?

- Implicit costs : costs that are quantifiable in monetary terms could be recognized in this category
- Explicit costs : some costs cannot be quantified in monetary terms or even dont represent a mathematical model, such costs are explicits costs : oppurthunity cost, time and forgone profits.

* In the event of decsion making generally agents consider the most acceptable explicit cost as the best alternative to all resources by considering the benefits they would get out of it, also implicit costs play large role in every aspect of ecnomic agents, they tend to act as the monetary scale to value ecnomic resources.

Explain the idea that resources have alternative uses and how it affects decision-making for economic agents.

* Talking about resources we should be aware that these are scarce and their another charactertic is the ability to be used in multiple ecnomic acticites as inputs thus resources have alternative used. It forces the ecconomic agents to use it fore the best alternative instead of considering all activites.

How does the concept of opportunity cost relate to the choices made by economic agents? Provide examples to support your answer.

* Oppurtnutiy cost arises on the event of sacrificing some other alternative ecnomic activites to a most suitable one, this is what ecnomic agents to in the event of limited resources.

Analyze the factors that economic agents consider when making decisions and how opportunity cost plays a role in their choices.

*  to briefly state the factors the agents consider :
- Resources availability
- Production possibilities
- Market condiitons
- Technological advancements

* They also consider some other aspects such as oppurtunity cost and risk and uncertainty of the enviornment and the economic activity.

Evaluate the relationship between benefits, costs, and opportunity cost in economic activities.

- befits are positive outcomes or gains that agents expect to recieve from the economic activities, usually the attractiveness of the activitiy depends on the extend to which the benefit outweighs the benefit.
- characteristic : can be tangible or intangible

- costs are the reoucres incurred during the economic actovtity to gain benefits, the usual tendancy of the market is to reduce costs as much as possible inorder to increse the scale of benefits

- oppurtinity cost is the alternative benifts sacrificed by choosing one economic actvity due to the limited availability of resources.

* relationship:
    - agents always weigh the cost and benfits before undertaking any economics actvities.
    - agents should identify and minimize explicit costs inorder to increse benefits
    - considering opc helps assess the viability of the economic activity
