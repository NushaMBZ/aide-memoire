#/Q 
### Law of Demand
#Q
Law of Demand :: Assuming that all the other factors are not changing, <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">quantity demand of a good  falls as the price of that good rises</mark> and vice  versa.
#/Q 
#### Demand Equation

>Qd=a-bP

`Qd` is the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">quantity demanded of the good or service.</mark>

# Firm
#Q 
A firm is an <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">economic agent</mark>. It behaves to <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">fulfill an objective and has a  role in the economy.</mark> All economic agents want to <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">maximize their objective</mark>. 
#/Q 

Firms <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">engage in economic activities to get benefits.</mark> The benefit the firms want to get is  known as profit ``(TR-TC=P)`` . In case of firms the objective is to <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">maximize profit</mark>. The firm is  an economic agent that <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">uses inputs and technology (Factors of production) to produce a good or a  service.</mark>

## Profit
#Q 
The financial gain achieved when the total revenue earned from selling goods or services exceeds the total costs incurred in producing and delivering those goods or services.
#/Q 


## Explicit costs
#Q 
Explicit costs :: are those costs that involve a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">monetary outlay and are easily quantifiable.</mark>
#/Q 

## Implicit Costs

Implicit costs :: the potential benefits or profits the company could have earned <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">if it had chosen a different use for its resources.</mark>
#/Q 

### Economic Profit
#Q
Economic profit, :: takes into consideration both explicit costs (similar to accounting profit) and implicit costs. Implicit costs represent the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">potential return the company could have earned from alternative uses of its resources.</mark>
#/Q 

> Economic Profit = Total Revenue - Total Explicit Costs - Total Implicit Costs

### Accounting Profit
Accounting profit is a straightforward measure that is commonly used in financial statements and reports. It is calculated by <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">deducting all explicit and measurable expenses</mark>, such as production costs, operating expenses, interest, and taxes, from the total revenue generated during a specific period.

> Accounting Profit = Total Revenue - Total Explicit Costs

## Theory of the Firm  
#Q
Theory of the Firm :: This is an economic concept that seeks to <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">understand the behavior and organization of firms</mark> within an economic system.
#/Q 

It aims to explain how <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">firms make decisions</mark> regarding <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">production, pricing, investment, and other strategic choices</mark> to maximize their profits or achieve their objectives.


### Production Function
#Q 
Production Function :: The relationship between <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">inputs (such as labor and capital) and output.</mark>
#/Q 
$$
Y=X_1,X_2,X_3
$$
Y=output
$X_1$= labor
$X_2$= capital
$X_3$ through $X_n$ are other  inputs used in production.

#### Variable inputs and Fixed Inputs

The firm <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">can change quantity of a variable input</mark> if  desired within a production period. However the amount of the input used <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">cannot  be changed</mark> within the production period if the input is a fixed input.  

#### Product Curves 
#Q
Total product (TP) :: This is the **total output that can be produced** with a given level of input.
#/Q 

#Q
Average Product (AP) :: AP is equal to the **TP divided by the level of inputs** used in production.
#/Q 

#Q
Marginal  product (MP) :: The <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">change in TP per unit change in input.</mark>
#/Q 
### Stages of Production
![[Pasted image 20230720123401.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230720123634.png]]
Stage 1: **Increasing Marginal Returns** means as more units of a variable input (such as labor) are added to a fixed input (such as capital), the total output <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">increases at an increasing rate.</mark>

Stage 2: **Diminishing Marginal Returns** means the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">total output still increases, but at a decreasing rate</mark> as more units of the variable input are added.

Stage 3: **Negative Marginal Returns** means the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">addition of more units of the variable input leads to a decline in total output.</mark>

### Cost of Production
#Q
Cost of Production :: The total <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">expenses incurred by a firm</mark> in the process of <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">manufacturing goods</mark> or providing services.
#/Q 
#### CoP categories

**Fixed Costs**: Expenses that do not vary with the level of production in the short run.

**Variable Costs:** Expenses that change in direct proportion to the level of production.

> TC = FC + VC

<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">TFC</mark> is a <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">constant value</mark> at all levels of output and shown as a straight line parallel to  X axis. 

TVC increases at decreasing rate and then increases at an increasing rate. 

TC curve lies on a parallel  position above the TVC curve as TFC is fixed and TC is the sum of TVC and TFC. 
- Average Fixed Cost=FC/Y
- Average Variable Cost=VC/Y
- Average Total Cost=AFC+AVC
- Marginal Cost (at a given level of Y)=$(\Delta TC)/(\Delta Y)$
