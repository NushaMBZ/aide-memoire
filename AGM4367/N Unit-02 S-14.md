### Extended Marketing Mix: People, Physical Evidence, and Process

#### People:

**Significance of People in Services:** People constitute a critical element of services. Since services are produced and consumed simultaneously, customer experiences are customized to cater to individual needs. The attitudes, skills, and appearance of staff play a pivotal role in influencing customer preferences. People tend to buy from individuals they like, making staff qualities essential.

**Role of People in Adding Value:** People enhance customer experiences by providing personalized service, training, and effective customer interactions. Skilled, motivated, and well-trained staff are vital for delivering quality services. Different types of salespersons include product delivery personnel, order takers, external field sales representatives, missionaries aiming to build goodwill, technical salespersons offering expertise, and creative sellers persuading customers to make a purchase.

**Impact of Customer Services Teams:** Customer services teams are crucial in many industries. They provide expertise, technical support, and coordinate customer interactions. The attitude and disposition of these teams significantly influence customer satisfaction, making effective communication and interaction essential.

#### Physical Evidence:

**Role of Physical Evidence in Services:** Physical evidence refers to the tangible aspects that support services when customers cannot rely solely on intangible attributes. Examples include packaging, websites, paperwork (invoices, brochures), furnishings, uniforms, business cards, and buildings.

#### Process:

**Understanding the Process Element:** Process is a part of the extended marketing mix (7Ps). It refers to the way customers access services. Processes can be means to achieve outcomes (e.g., market share goals) or interconnected activities forming an overall marketing process (e.g., telemarketing and internet marketing integration).

**Role of Process in the Marketing Mix:** In the context of the marketing mix, process pertains to the customer's experience with an organization's offerings. For instance, booking a flight online involves visiting the airline's website, entering flight details, booking, and receiving confirmation via email or post. This entire process shapes the customer's perception.

#### Integration and Marketing Process:

**Value Delivery and Feedback:** The marketing process delivers value through all mix elements. Customer feedback helps refine and adjust the mix. Customer retention is crucial, and businesses extend and market additional products or services to existing customers.

**Tailoring the Process:** The process can be customized to meet the unique needs of different individuals experiencing a similar service concurrently. Adapting the process enhances customer satisfaction and engagement.

## ## The Four "C's"

The Four "C's" offers a more customer-centric perspective on marketing. Proposed by Robert Lauterborn and endorsed by Philip Kotler, the Four "C's" provide a modern framework to approach marketing:

### 1. Convenience (Formerly Place):

In the Four "C's" framework, "Place" transforms into "Convenience." This shift emphasizes the importance of making products and services readily accessible and easy to obtain for customers. 

### 2. Cost to the User (Formerly Price):

"Price" is reimagined as "Cost to the user." Instead of solely focusing on the monetary aspect, this perspective takes into account the total cost incurred by the customer.

### 3. Communication (Formerly Promotion):

"Promotion" evolves into "Communication." This change reflects a shift from simply promoting products to engaging in meaningful communication with customers. 

### 4. Customer Needs and Wants (Formerly Product):

"Product" is replaced by "Customer needs and wants." This alteration underscores the importance of aligning offerings with the specific requirements and desires of customers.

## Evaluating the Four "C's"

The Four "C's" offer a client-centric approach to marketing, emphasizing customer convenience, cost considerations, effective communication, and tailored solutions. This approach challenges the traditional product-oriented perspective of the marketing mix.

While the Four "C's" present a valuable alternative, the original Four "P's" (Product, Price, Place, and Promotion) remain deeply ingrained in marketing terminology and practice. The "P's" provide a memorable and well-established framework for analysis. However, as marketing evolves to become more customer-oriented, the Four "C's" offer a fresh viewpoint that can enhance customer satisfaction and engagement.
