## Elements of Communication

Communication is a complex process that involves <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">the exchange of information, ideas, thoughts, and feelings between individuals or groups. </mark>

There are several key elements of communication that are essential for effective and successful communication:

1. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Sender</mark>: The sender is the <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">person or entity initiating the communication.</mark>
    
2. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Message</mark>: The message is the <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">content or information that the sender wishes to communicate.</mark> 
    
3. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Encoding</mark>: Encoding is the <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">process by which the sender translates their thoughts and ideas into a format that can be understood by the receiver.</mark>
    
4. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Channel</mark>: The channel is the <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">medium or method through which the message is transmitted</mark> from the sender to the receiver.
    
5. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Receiver</mark>: The receiver is the <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">person or group of people for whom the message is intended.</mark>
    
6. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Decoding</mark>: Decoding is the process by which the <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">receiver interprets and understands the message sent by the sender.</mark>
    
7. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Feedback</mark>: Feedback is the <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">response or reaction provided by the receiver to the sender's message.</mark>
    
8. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Noise</mark>: Noise refers to <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">any interference or distortion in the communication process</mark> that can disrupt the clarity and accuracy of the message.
    
9. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Context</mark>: The context of communication includes the <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">situational factors, environment, and cultural norms</mark> that influence how the message is perceived and understood.
    
10. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Feedback Loop</mark>: Effective communication often involves <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">an ongoing feedback loop where the sender and receiver exchange messages and responses</mark> to ensure mutual understanding.

## Electrical Communication

The<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> transmission of information or data between two or more points using electrical signals</mark> as the medium for conveying the information.

### Electrical Communication System
![[Pasted image 20231027075124.png]]
In a given electrical communication system, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">input transducer converts the original information signal into an electrical signal</mark> 
(or an optical signal).

An electrical signal may be any one or more of the following types which are time variant signals. (i.e. varies with time). 
▪ <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">current in an electric circuit</mark>. 
▪ <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">voltage across a resistive component of a circuit</mark>. 
▪ <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">magnetic or electric field at a defined point.</mark>

Transmitter is a device which is <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">capable of generating electrical signals in the form of varying current, voltage or electromagnetic field.</mark>

The modulation process takes place in the transmitter.

Receiver is <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">a device which is capable of receiving these signals and reproducing them in the original form.</mark>

Then again an output transducer is used to <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">reconvert the received electrical signal (or optical signal) into the original form.</mark>


## Signals
Electrical or electromagnetic representations of information that are <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">used to convey data from one point to another.</mark>

### Types of Signals

#### **Analog Signals** 

Analog signals are <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">continuous waveforms that vary smoothly over time.</mark> They can take any value within a continuous range, and their amplitude, frequency, or phase can change in a continuous manner. Common examples of analog signals include electrical voltages, audio signals, and analog radio waves. 

#### **Digital Signals**

Digital signals, on the other hand, a<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">re discrete and quantized representations of information. They have two distinct levels, typically represented as 0 and 1, and are used to transmit binary data.</mark> Digital signals are more robust against noise and interference, making them well-suited for long-distance communication.

## Bandwidth

The range of <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">frequencies over which a signal or communication channel can effectively transmit data. </mark>

> [!TIP] 
> It is commonly measured in hertz (Hz) and represents the width or capacity of the frequency spectrum available for transmitting information.

▪ Human voice 100 Hz – 10 000 Hz 
▪ Human hearing 20 Hz – 15 000 Hz 
▪ Commercial speech 300 Hz – 3400 Hz 
▪ Mains electricity 50 Hz – 60 Hz


### Signal Bandwidth

Signal bandwidth refers to <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">the range of frequencies that a signal occupies or the range of frequencies required to represent a particular signal.</mark> It is a property of the signal itself.
  
- In the context of analog signals, the signal bandwidth is the difference between the highest and lowest frequencies present in the signal. For example, in an audio signal, the signal bandwidth might be from 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz (the range of human hearing).
  
- In the context of digital signals, the signal bandwidth can be related to the data rate of the signal. For instance, a digital signal with a data rate of 1 Mbps typically has a signal bandwidth of approximately 1 MHz.

### Channel Bandwidth

Channel bandwidth, on the other hand, refers to <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">the range of frequencies that a communication channel or medium can effectively transmit</mark> without significant attenuation or distortion. 
  
- The channel bandwidth determines how much information or data can be transmitted through the channel. It sets a limit on the maximum signal bandwidth that can be accommodated without significant loss or degradation.
  
- In practice, the channel bandwidth is often specified as a fixed value for communication systems. For example, a wireless communication system might have a channel bandwidth of 20 MHz, which means it can transmit signals with a signal bandwidth of up to 20 MHz effectively.
