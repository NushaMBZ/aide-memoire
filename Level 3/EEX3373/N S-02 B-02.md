# Components

## **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)** 
Responsible for <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">performing arithmetic and logic operations</mark> on data words. 

It receives two main inputs: one from the accumulator and another from the data register. It can add, subtract, or perform logic operations (e.g., AND, OR) based on control signals.

### The Status Register
(aka the flag register) This is a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">separate register that stores information about the results of these operations.</mark>
## **Accumulator** 

The accumulator is a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">register within the microprocessor.</mark> It serves a dual function during operation. Before an operation, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">it holds one of the operands, and after the operation, it holds the result.</mark> The accumulator is involved in several instructions, such as loading data from memory into the accumulator and storing data from the accumulator back into memory.

## **Data Register** 

The data register is a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">temporary storage location for data moving to or from the data bus.</mark> It holds data during various operations, including instruction decoding and data storage in memory.

## **Program Counter** 

The program counter <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">controls the sequence of instructions in a program. </mark>It keeps track of the memory location from which the next instruction is to be fetched, typically incrementing sequentially.

## **Control Unit** 

The control unit<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> generates various control signals required to execute instructions.</mark> Different instructions require different combinations of control signals to ensure that the operation described by the instruction is carried out correctly.

## Memory Address Register

The Memory Address Register (MAR) is a register in a computer's central processing unit (CPU) that holds the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">memory address of the data that the CPU needs to access from or write</mark> to in the computer's memory (RAM).
