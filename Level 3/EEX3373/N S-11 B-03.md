# Internet

Internet is a network of interconnected heterogeneous networks. 

> [!tip]
> The communication links that interconnect these host computers use a common protocol known as TCP/IP.

## Internet Adminstration

Internet administration is the process of <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">managing and regulating various aspects of the global Internet.</mark> 

1. **IAB (<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Internet Architecture Board</mark>):** The IAB is responsible for <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">overseeing the standards and development of the Internet.</mark>
    
2. **IETF (<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Internet Engineering Task Force</mark>):** IETF is a key component of the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">IAB and primarily focuses on the technical aspects of the Internet.</mark>
    
3. **IRTF (<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Internet Research Task Force</mark>):** IRTF conducts research projects aimed at <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">addressing long-term challenges and opportunities </mark>in the world of networking and the Internet.
    
4. **ISOC (<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Internet Society</mark>):** ISOC is a global organization that <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">advocates for the use of the Internet as a means of communication and collaboration. </mark>
    
5. **IANA (<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Internet Assigned Numbers Authority</mark>):** IANA historically managed IP <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">address space and various TCP/IP-related numbers,</mark> such as protocol numbers and domain name system (DNS) parameters.

## Concepts

1. **<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Host</mark>:** A host is <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">any computer connected to the Internet</mark> that can provide information for other users to access and retrieve. Hosts can serve web pages, store data, or provide various services.
    
2. **<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Server</mark>:** A server can <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">refer to both a program implementing a service (e.g., a web server like Apache) and the host computer on which the service runs.</mark> Servers are responsible for processing and responding to client requests.
    
3. **<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)</mark>:** ARP is used to <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">find the physical address (MAC address) of a network node</mark> when its IP address is known. It's essential for local network communication.
    
4. **<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Hostname</mark>:** A hostname is the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">name assigned to a computer or device</mark>. It's used for identification and can be a part of a fully-qualified domain name (FQDN).
    
5. **<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">IP Address</mark>:** An IP address is a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">numeric label assigned to network devices for identification and routing purposes.</mark> IPv4 addresses consist of four sets of eight bits (32 bits total), while IPv6 addresses are 128 bits long and use hexadecimal notation.
    
6. **<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Domain Name</mark>:** A domain name is a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">hierarchical naming system used to identify the domain to which a host belongs.</mark> It often includes multiple levels, such as "example.com," where "com" is the top-level domain (TLD).
    
7. **<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Gateway Address</mark>:** The gateway address is <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">the IP address of a router that connects an internal network to an external network, such as the Internet.</mark> It serves as the exit point for traffic from the internal network.
    
8. **<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Domain Name Server (DNS)</mark>:** DNS is a critical service that <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">converts human-friendly, fully-qualified domain names</mark> (e.g., [www.example.com](http://www.example.com/)) <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">into IP addresses</mark> that computers can use to route and locate resources on the Internet.

## **TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)**

This is a is a suite of communication protocols used to interconnect network devices on the internet and other computer networks.

### TCP/IP Addressing

TCP/IP includes an Internet addressing scheme that <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">allows users and applications to identify a specific network or host to communicate with.</mark>

#### Internet Addresses

The <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Internet Protocol (IP) uses a 32-bit</mark>, <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">two-part address field. The 32 bits are divided into four octets</mark> as in the following:

```
01111101 00001101 01001001 00001111
```

These binary numbers translate into:

```
125 13 73 15
```

The two parts of an Internet address are the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">network address portion and the host address portion.</mark> This allows a remote host to specify both the remote network and the host on the remote network when sending information. By convention, a host number of 0 (zero) is used to refer to the network itself.

TCP/IP supports three classes of Internet addresses: Class A, Class B, and Class C. The different classes of Internet addresses are designated by <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">how the 32 bits of the address are allocated.</mark> The particular address class a network is assigned depends on the size of the network.

##### Class A Addresses

A Class A address consists of an <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">8-bit network address and a 24-bit local or host address.</mark> The <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">first bit in the network address is dedicated to indicating the network class</mark>, leaving 7 bits for the actual network address. Since <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">the highest number that 7 bits can represent in binary is 128, there are 128 possible Class A network addresses.</mark> Of the 128 possible network addresses,<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;"> two are reserved for special cases</mark>:<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;"> the network address 127 is reserved for local loopback addresses, and a network address of all ones indicates a broadcast address.</mark>

Therefore, there are 126 possible Class A network addresses and 16,777,216 possible local host addresses. In a Class A address , the highest order bit is set to 0.

![[Pasted image 20231026221357.png]]

In other words, the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">first octet of a Class A address is in the range 1 to 126.</mark>

##### Class B Addresses

A Class B address consists of a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">16-bit network address and a 16-bit local or host address.</mark> The <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">first two bits in the network address are dedicated to indicating the network class</mark>, leaving 14 bits for the actual network address. Therefore, there are 16,384 possible network addresses and 65,536 local host addresses. In a Class B address , the highest order bits are set to 1 and 0.

![[Pasted image 20231026221738.png]]

In other words, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">the first octet of a Class B address is in the range 128 to 191.</mark>


##### Class C Addresses

A Class C address consists of a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">24-bit network address and an 8-bit local host address.</mark> The first <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">two bits in the network address are dedicated to indicating the network class, leaving 22 bits for the actual network address.</mark> Therefore, there are 2,097,152 possible network addresses and 256 possible local host addresses. In a Class C address , the highest order bits are set to 1 and 1.

![[Pasted image 20231026222010.png]]

In other words, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">the first octet of a Class C address is in the range 192 to 223.</mark>

![[Pasted image 20231027103845.png]]
##### Internet Addresses Using Zeros

When a C class Internet address contains <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">a 0 as the host address portion, (for example, 192.9.200.0), TCP/IP sends a wildcard address on the network. </mark>

This means that all machines with a Class C address of 192.9.200._X_ (where _X_ represents a value between 0 and 254) should respond to the request.

#### Subnet Addresses

Subnet addressing allows an <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">autonomous system made up of multiple networks to share the same Internet address.</mark> The subnetwork capability of TCP/IP also makes <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">it possible to divide a single network into multiple logical networks (subnets).</mark> 

> [!example]
>  An organization can have a single Internet network address that is known to users outside the organization, yet configure its network internally into departmental subnets. In either case, fewer Internet network addresses are required while local routing capabilities are enhanced.

A standard Internet Protocol address field has two parts: <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">a network address and a local address.</mark> To make subnets possible, the local address part of an Internet address is divided into a subnet number and a host number. The <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">subnet is identified so that the local autonomous system can route messages reliably.</mark>

![[Pasted image 20231027004431.png]]

In the basic Class A Internet address which consists of <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">an 8-bit network address and 24-bit local address</mark>, the local address identifies the specific host machine on the network.

To create a subnet address for this Class A Internet address, the local address can be divided into a number identifying the physical network (or subnet) and a number identifying the host on the subnet. Senders route messages to the advertised network address, and the local system takes responsibility for routing messages to its subnets and their hosts. When deciding how to partition the local address into subnet address and host address, one should consider the number of subnets and the number of hosts on those subnets.

In the following figure, the local address is partitioned into a 12-bit subnet address and a 12-bit host address.

![[Pasted image 20231027005752.png]]

There is great flexibility when assigning subnet addresses and host addresses. The bits of the local address can be divided according to the needs and potential growth of the organization and its network structure. The only restrictions are:

- `network_address` is the Internet address for the network.
- `subnet_address` is a field of a constant width for a given network.
- `host_address` is a field that is at least 1-bit wide.

If the width of the subnet_address field is 0, the network is not organized into subnets, and addressing to the network is performed using the Internet network address.

The bits that identify the subnet are specified by a bit mask and, therefore, are not required to be adjacent in the address. However, it is generally desirable for the subnet bits to be contiguous and located as the most significant bits of the local address.

#### Subnet Masks

When a host sends a message to a destination, the system must <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">determine whether the destination is on the same network as the source or if the destination can be reached directly through one of the local interfaces.</mark> The system compares the destination address to the host address using the subnet mask. If the destination is not local, the system sends the message on to a gateway. The gateway performs the same comparison to see if the destination address is on a network it can reach locally.

The <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">subnet mask tells the system what the subnet partitioning scheme is.</mark> This bit mask consists of the network address portion and subnet address portion of the Internet address.

> [!example]
> The subnet mask of the Class A address with the partitioning scheme defined above is shown in this figure.

![[Pasted image 20231027010212.png]]


The subnet mask is a set of 4 bytes, just like the Internetwork address. The subnet mask consists of high bits (1's) corresponding to the bit positions of the network and subnetwork address, and low bits (0's) corresponding to the bit positions of the host address. A subnet mask for the above address looks like the following figure.

#### Broadcast Addresses

The TCP/IP can send data to all hosts on a local network or to all hosts on all directly connected networks. Such transmissions are called _broadcast messages_. 

> [!example]
> the **routed** routing daemon uses broadcast messages to query and respond to routing queries.

For data to be broadcast to all hosts on all directly connected networks, User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and Internet Protocol (IP) are used to send the data, and the host destination address in the IP header has all bits set to 1. For data to be broadcast to all hosts on a specific network, all the bits in the local address part of the IP address are set to 0. There are no user commands that use the broadcast capability, although such commands, or programs, can be developed.

The broadcast address can be changed temporarily by changing the _broadcast_ parameter in the **ifconfig** command. Change the broadcast address permanently by using the Web-based System Manager fast path, **wsm network**, or the SMIT fast path **smit chinet**. Changing the broadcast address may be useful if there is a need to be compatible with older versions of software that use a different broadcast address; for example, the host IDs are all set to 0.
