# Memory
Memory serves as a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">storage medium for both program instructions and data.</mark> Memory stores the instructions that the computer's central processing unit (CPU) executes and also holds data that the CPU processes.

## Address
Memory locations in a computer are identified by unique addresses. These <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">addresses are used to specify the location in memory where data or instructions are stored.</mark>

**Address Bus**: The computer system uses two buses for communication with memory: the address bus and the data bus. The address bus carries a 16-bit binary number, allowing it to specify one of 65,535 memory locations. Each location is assigned a unique address.

**Address Range**: The address range for memory locations typically starts at 0 and goes up to 65,535. The first location is given an address of 0, and the last location has an address of 65,535. This range is represented in binary as 1111111111111111 and in hexadecimal as FFFF.

Selecting a Memory Location: To access a specific memory location, the computer places the 16-bit address of that location on the address bus. The contents of the address register in the Microprocessor Unit (MPU) are typically placed on the address bus for this purpose.

Address Decoder: Within the memory circuit, there is an address decoder. It interprets the 16-bit address on the address bus and selects the appropriate memory location based on that address.

Control Signal: In addition to the address, the MPU sends a control signal to the memory. This control signal indicates the operation that the memory should perform.

# Read Operation
It involves the process of retrieving data or information from a specific memory location.

1. **Addressing the Memory Location**:
    
    - The central processing unit (CPU) or microprocessor initiates a READ operation by specifying the memory address of the location from which data needs to be read. 
    - The CPU then places the memory address onto the address bus, a set of electrical pathways that connect the CPU to the memory subsystem.
      
2. **Address Decoding**:
    
    - Within the memory subsystem, there is an address decoder. This component interprets the memory address placed on the address bus and determines which specific memory location is being accessed.
    - The address decoder selects the memory cell or location that corresponds to the provided address.
      
3. **READ Signal**:
    
    - After the memory location is selected, the CPU sends a READ signal or command to the memory subsystem. This signal informs the memory that the CPU intends to retrieve data from the selected memory location.
      
4. **Data Retrieval**:
    
    - Upon receiving the READ command, the memory retrieves the data stored at the selected memory location.
    - The data is then placed onto the data bus, another set of electrical pathways that connect the memory subsystem to the CPU.
      
1. **Transfer to CPU**:
    
    - The CPU, having issued the READ command and placed the memory address on the address bus, is now ready to receive the data.
    - The data, which has been placed on the data bus by the memory, is transferred from the data bus to the CPU's internal data register. This register is where the CPU temporarily holds data for further processing.
      
6. **Data Usage**:
    
    - Once the data is in the CPU's data register, it can be used by the CPU for various purposes. This might involve arithmetic calculations, logical operations, or simply storing the data in another location in memory.
      
7. **Memory Remains Unaltered**:
    
    - Importantly, the act of reading data from a memory location does not alter or modify the contents of that location. The data remains intact at its original memory address unless explicitly overwritten or modified by a WRITE operation.

## Write Operation

![[Pasted image 20231004075839.png]]

1. **Addressing the Memory Location**:
    
    - The central processing unit (CPU) or microprocessor initiates a WRITE operation by specifying the memory address of the location where data needs to be written.
    - The CPU places the memory address onto the address bus, which connects the CPU to the memory subsystem.
      
2. **Address Decoding**:
    
    - Within the memory subsystem, there is an address decoder. This component interprets the memory address placed on the address bus and determines which specific memory location is being accessed for writing.
      
3. **Data to be Written**:
    
    - The CPU prepares the data that it wants to write into the selected memory location. 
      
4. **WRITE Signal**:
    
    - After specifying the memory address and preparing the data to be written, the CPU sends a WRITE signal or command to the memory subsystem. 
5. **Data Writing**:
    
    - Upon receiving the WRITE command, the memory subsystem stores the data provided by the CPU into the selected memory location. The new data overwrites the previous content of that memory location.
    - The data is typically placed onto the data bus, which connects the memory subsystem to the CPU. The memory writes the data from the data bus into the specified memory cell.
      
6. **Confirmation**:
    
    - The memory may send a confirmation signal or status acknowledgment back to the CPU to indicate that the WRITE operation has been successfully completed. This confirmation ensures that the CPU knows the data has been written as intended.
      
7. **Memory Updated**:
    
    - After the WRITE operation is completed, the memory location now contains the newly written data. The previous data that was stored at that location is replaced by the new data.


# RAM & ROM
1. **Random Access Memory (RAM)**:
    
    - The term "Random Access" in RAM means that all memory locations within RAM are equally accessible.
    - RAM is often referred to as "Random Access Read/Write Memory" because it allows both reading and writing operations. This means that data can be both stored (written) and retrieved (read) from RAM.
2. **Read-Only Memory (ROM)**:
    
    - ROM is another type of computer memory.
    - Like RAM, ROM is also randomly accessible, meaning that any location within ROM can be accessed directly.
    - However, ROM does not have a write capability. In other words, data cannot be written to ROM once it has been programmed. ROM is designed to be read-only, and its contents are typically set during the manufacturing process and remain constant throughout the life of the device.
