# Computer Networking

Computer networking is the practice of connecting multiple computers or computing devices together to share resources and information.


## Data Communications

Data communication is the process of transferring digital data in a reliable and efficient manner.

## Network Architectures

Network architectures refer to the design and structure of a computer network, outlining how its components and devices are organized and how data is transmitted between them.

1. **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Architecture**: In a P2P network, all devices (peers) have equal status and can act as both clients and servers. 
    
2. **Client-Server Architecture**: In a client-server architecture, network resources and services are centralized on a dedicated server. Clients, such as individual computers, smartphones, or other devices, request services from the server.
    
3. **Centralized Network Architecture**: This architecture involves a single central hub that connects all devices in the network.

## OSI Reference Model

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) reference model is a conceptual framework used to standardize and describe the functions of a telecommunications or network system.

1. **Physical Layer (Layer 1)**: This is the lowest layer and deals with the physical medium used to transmit data, such as cables, connectors, and electrical signals.
    
2. **Data Link Layer (Layer 2)**: This layer is responsible for data framing, error detection, and access control to the physical medium. 
    
3. **Network Layer (Layer 3)**: The network layer focuses on addressing and routing packets of data so they can traverse multiple networks to reach their destination.
    
4. **Transport Layer (Layer 4)**: This layer is responsible for end-to-end communication and data flow control.
    
5. **Session Layer (Layer 5)**: The session layer manages and establishes communication sessions between applications.
    
6. **Presentation Layer (Layer 6)**: This layer is responsible for data translation, encryption, and compression, ensuring that data is presented in a format that the application layer can understand. 
    
7. **Application Layer (Layer 7)**: The top layer is the one closest to the end-user. Application layer protocols like HTTP, FTP, and SMTP operate here.

## TCP/IP

TCP/IP, which stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, is a set of networking protocols that form the foundation for communication and data exchange on the internet and many other computer networks.

TCP/IP is structured into two primary protocols:

1. **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)**: TCP is a connection-oriented protocol that ensures reliable data transmission between devices. 
    
2. **Internet Protocol (IP)**: IP is a connectionless protocol that provides the addressing and routing of data packets.
