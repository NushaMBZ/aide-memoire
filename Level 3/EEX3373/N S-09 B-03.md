## Classification

1. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Based on Scale and Coverage: (Geographical area)</mark>
    
    - **<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Local Area Network (LAN):</mark>** A LAN is a network that covers a <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">small geographical area</mark>.
    - **<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Wide Area Network (WAN):</mark>** WANs cover a <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">larger geographical area and often connect LANs in different locations.</mark> The internet itself can be considered a global WAN.
    - **<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)</mark>:** MANs are networks that <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">cover a city or a large campus</mark>, bridging the gap between LANs and WANs.
      
2. **<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Based on Connection Method</mark> (Line Configuration):**
    
    - **<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Point-to-Point Network</mark>:** In this network, <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">two devices are connected directly</mark> to each other. 
    - **<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Broadcast Network</mark>:** Multiple devices are <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">connected to a common communication medium</mark>, and data is broadcast to all connected devices.

## OSI Reference Model

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) reference model is a <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">conceptual framework used to standardize and describe the functions of a network system.</mark>

1. <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Physical Layer (Layer 1)</mark>: This is the lowest layer and deals with the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">physical medium used to transmit data</mark>, such as cables, connectors, and electrical signals.
    
2. <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Data Link Layer (Layer 2)</mark>: This layer is responsible for <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">data framing, error detection, and access control</mark> to the physical medium. 
    
3. <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Network Layer (Layer 3)</mark>: The network layer focuses on <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">addressing and routing packets of data</mark> so they can traverse multiple networks to reach their destination.
    
4. <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Transport Layer (Layer 4)</mark>: This layer is responsible for <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">end-to-end communication and data flow control.</mark>
    
5. <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Session Layer (Layer 5)</mark>: The session layer <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">manages and establishes communication sessions between applications.</mark>
    
6. <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Presentation Layer (Layer 6)</mark>: This layer is responsible for <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">data translation, encryption, and compression, ensuring that data is presented in a format that the application layer can understand. </mark>
    
7. <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Application Layer (Layer 7)</mark>: The top layer is the one <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">closest to the end-user.</mark> Application layer protocols like HTTP, FTP, and SMTP operate here.

## TCP/IP

TCP/IP, which stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, is a <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">set of networking protocols that form the foundation for communication and data exchange on the internet </mark>and many other computer networks.

![[Pasted image 20231027085005.png]]

TCP/IP is structured into two primary protocols:

1. **<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)</mark>**: TCP is a <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">connection-oriented protocol</mark> that ensures reliable data transmission between devices. 
    
2. **<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Internet Protocol (IP)</mark>**: IP is a <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">connectionless protocol that provides the addressing and routing of data packets.</mark>


### Components

1. **<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Network Access Layer (Link Layer)</mark>:**
    
    - The Network Access Layer is the lowest layer of the TCP/IP suite and <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">deals with the physical and data-link aspects of network communication.</mark>
    - It encompasses various technologies and protocols used to transmit data over the physical medium, including <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol).</mark>
    - At this layer, <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">data is encapsulated into frames, and devices communicate using hardware addresses</mark> (e.g., MAC addresses).
2. **<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Internet Layer (Network Layer):</mark>**
    
    - The Internet Layer is <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">responsible for addressing, routing, and forwarding data packets</mark> across networks.
    - It is primarily associated with the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Internet Protocol (IP) and includes both IPv4 and IPv6.</mark>
    - IP addresses are used for <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">uniquely identifying devices on the network, and routers</mark> play a critical role in forwarding packets based on destination IP addresses.
3. **<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Transport Layer</mark>:**
    
    - The Transport Layer <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">manages end-to-end communication between devices.</mark>
    - It includes two primary transport protocols:
        - **<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)</mark>:** Offers reliable, connection-oriented communication with error-checking, sequencing, and flow control.
        - **<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">User Datagram Protocol (UDP)</mark>:** Provides connectionless, lightweight communication without the reliability features of TCP.
    - The Transport Layer <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">uses port numbers to identify specific services or applications</mark> on a device.
4. **<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Internet Layer (Host-to-Host Layer)</mark>:**
    
    - This layer includes protocols that <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">allow communication between processes or services</mark> running on different devices.
    - Common protocols at this layer include:
        - **<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</mark>:** Used for web browsing.
        - **<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">File Transfer Protocol (FTP)</mark>:** Used for file transfers.
        - **<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)</mark>:** Used for sending email.
        - **<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Post Office Protocol (POP) and Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)</mark>:** Used for retrieving email.
5. **<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Application Layer</mark>:**
    
    - The Application Layer provides a <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">user interface and access to various network services and applications</mark>.
    - It supports <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">end-user applications and facilitates communication between applications</mark> and the lower layers of the TCP/IP suite.
    - This layer encompasses a wide range of application protocols, such as <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">DNS (Domain Name System), SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol), and Telnet.</mark>
