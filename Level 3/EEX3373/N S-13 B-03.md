- [ ] # **Modulation**

Modulation is the process of <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">encoding information, typically in the form of digital data or an analog signal, onto a carrier signal of a higher frequency.</mark> The carrier signal, also known as the carrier wave, serves as the transport medium for the information.

## Types of Modulation

### Analog Modulation
Analog modulation involves <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">varying the characteristics of the carrier wave in a way that replicates the variations</mark> in the original analog signal.

#### **Key Concepts in Analog Modulation:**

1. **<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Carrier Signal</mark>:** Analog modulation starts with <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">a high-frequency carrier signal, </mark>typically a sine wave, which serves as the carrier wave. 
    
2. **<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Information Signal</mark>:** The information signal is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">the analog signal that carries the actual information</mark> to be transmitted. 
    
3. **<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Modulation Process</mark>:** Analog modulation involves <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">changing one or more properties of the carrier signal to mirror the variations in the information signal. </mark>
    

#### **Common Types of Analog Modulation:**

##### **<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Amplitude Modulation (AM)</mark>** 
In AM, the amplitude of the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">carrier signal is varied in proportion to the instantaneous amplitude of the information signal.</mark> This means that <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">the carrier wave's strength is increased or decreased according to the strength of the audio signal at any given time.</mark>

For a carrier signal, $C(t)$, with frequency $f_c$, and an information signal, $M(t)$, with frequency $f_m$, the AM waveform can be represented as:

$$AM(t) = (1 + k \times M(t)) \times \cos(2\pi \times f_c \times t)$$
In this formula:

- $AM(t)$ represents the amplitude-modulated signal.
- $M(t)$ represents the information signal.
- $k$ represents the modulation index, which determines the extent to which the carrier wave's amplitude is modulated by the information signal.
- $f_c$â€‹ represents the carrier signal's frequency.
- $t$ represents time.

##### **<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Frequency Modulation (FM)</mark>** 
In FM, the frequency of the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">carrier signal is altered in response to the variations in the information signal.</mark> <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">The faster the variations in the information signal, the wider the frequency changes in the carrier signal.</mark>

##### **<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Phase Modulation (PM)</mark>**
PM varies the phase of the carrier signal based on <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">the variations in the information signal.</mark>

#### **Advantages and Applications of Analog Modulation:**

- **<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Simple and Robust</mark>:** Analog modulation is <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">relatively simple to implement and can be robust in transmitting information</mark> over a range of distances and environments.
    
- **<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Audio Transmission</mark>:** It is commonly used in <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">applications where the quality of audio transmission is essential</mark>, such as AM and FM radio broadcasting.
    
- **<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Wireless Communication</mark>:** Analog modulation has been a foundation for many early wireless communication systems, including broadcast radio and early television.


#### **Limitations:**

- **<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Inefficiency</mark>:** Analog modulation can be <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">less efficient in terms of bandwidth usage compared to digital modulation techniques</mark>, which offer better spectral efficiency.
    
- **<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Susceptibility to Noise</mark>:** Analog signals are <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">more susceptible to noise and interference, which can affect signal quality.</mark>

### Digital Modulation

This is a fundamental technique used in communication systems to transmit digital data (0s and 1s) over a physical channel, such as a wire, optical fiber, or wireless medium.

#### **Modulation Schemes:** 

Common modulation schemes include:

**Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK):** In ASK, the amplitude of the carrier signal is varied to represent binary symbols. High amplitude represents one symbol, and low amplitude represents the other.

**Frequency Shift Keying (FSK):** FSK involves changing the frequency of the carrier signal to represent digital symbols. Different frequencies correspond to 0 and 1.

**Phase Shift Keying (PSK):** PSK changes the phase of the carrier signal to represent digital symbols. Different phase shifts are used for 0s and 1s.

**Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM):** QAM combines both amplitude and phase modulation to transmit multiple bits per symbol. It is commonly used in high-speed data communication.

# **Demodulation**

Demodulation, or demodulating, is the reverse process of modulation. It involves <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">extracting the original information signal from the modulated carrier signal.</mark>
