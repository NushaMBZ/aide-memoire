# Computer
A computer is a device, which contains a microprocessor, memory devices for storing information and interface controllers to connect it with the outside world and a clock to act as the master timer for the whole system.

# Microprocessors
A microprocessor is a central processing unit (CPU) designed to execute instructions and perform calculations in digital electronic devices.
# Algorithms
An algorithm is a <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">set of explicitly defined steps to be followed that will lead to a particular end within a finite number of steps.</mark>

- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Explicitly defined</mark>- steps are clear and unambiguous instructions that can only be interpreted in one possible manner.
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">A finite number of steps</mark> imply that the algorithm must terminate after a specific number of steps, it cannot keep repeating forever under any circumstances.

# Stored Program
The idea of <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">storing both data and instructions (programs) in a computer's memory, allowing the computer to treat instructions as data and enabling it to execute a wide range of programs.</mark>

# Word
In computing, a word is indeed <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">a fundamental unit of information.</mark> Here's a bit more detail on the concept of a word:

1. **Word Size:** The size of a word can vary depending on the computer architecture. Common word sizes include 8 bits (1 byte), 16 bits (2 bytes), 32 bits (4 bytes), and 64 bits (8 bytes).
    
2. **Data Storage:** A word can represent various types of data, including numbers, characters, addresses, or other information. For example, in a 32-bit computer, a word could represent a 32-bit binary number, a single character in an ASCII encoding, or a memory address.
    
3. **Instruction Execution:** In a computer's central processing unit (CPU), instructions are typically represented as words. The CPU fetches these instruction words from memory, decodes them to determine the operation to be performed, and then executes the instruction.
    
4. **Addressing:** In memory systems, a word can also refer to an addressable unit. This means that when you read or write data from or to memory, you often do so in word-sized chunks. 
    
5. **Data Manipulation:** Arithmetic and logical operations are often performed on entire words, especially in integer arithmetic. For example, you might add two 32-bit numbers together as two 32-bit words.
    
6. **Character Encoding:** In character-based systems like ASCII or Unicode, a word can represent a single character. For instance, in ASCII, the word size is typically 8 bits, representing one character.
    
7. **Data Types:** Different data types (integers, floating-point numbers, characters, etc.) are stored and manipulated as words of the appropriate size. For example, a 32-bit word can store a 32-bit integer.
    
8. **Endianess:** The order in which the individual bytes within a word are stored can be significant. Some computer architectures use little-endian, while others use big-endian byte ordering.
