#### Description

In a ring topology, devices are <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">connected in a closed-loop or circular fashion</mark>, where each device is<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> connected to exactly two other devices</mark>, forming a continuous ring. Data travels in one direction around the ring until it reaches its destination.


#### - **Characteristics:**
    
- **<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Unidirectional and Bidirectional Rings</mark>:** Ring topologies <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">can be unidirectional,</mark> where data circulates in a single direction,<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;"> or bidirectional,</mark> allowing data to travel in both directions around the ring.
- **<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Token Passing</mark>:** In some ring networks, <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">a token-passing protocol is used to control access to the network.</mark> Only the device with the token can transmit data, which helps prevent collisions.

#### Advantages
    
- **<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Predictable Performance</mark>:** Ring topologies offer <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">predictable data transmission</mark>, as data travels in a specific order around the ring.

- **<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Scalability</mark>:** Ring networks can be <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">relatively easily expanded by adding new devices to the ring.</mark>
#### Disadvantages
    
- **<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Single Point of Failure</mark>:** If <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">any device or connection in the ring fails, it can disrupt the entire network.</mark> In unidirectional rings, a single failure can break the entire network.
- **<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Complex Troubleshooting</mark>:** <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Identifying and repairing network issues can be complex</mark> when a failure occurs. Devices may need to be bypassed to restore network connectivity.
- **<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Latency</mark>:** Data <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">may need to circulate the entire ring before reaching its destination,</mark> leading to potential latency in larger networks.
#### Use Cases
    
- **<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Token Ring Networks</mark>:** Token Ring, a specific type of ring topology, <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">was used in some older LANs.</mark> It employed token passing to control data transmission.

### Star Topology

#### Description

In a star topology, <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">all devices in the network are connected to a central hub or switch.</mark> Data traffic flows through this central point, and devices do not connect directly to each other.

#### Characteristics
    
- **<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Central Hub or Switch</mark>:** The central hub or <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">switch serves as the focal point for all network connections.</mark> It manages the data transmission between devices.
- **<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Point-to-Point Connections</mark>:** Each device has a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">dedicated, point-to-point connection to the central hub.</mark> This means that data transmitted by one device to another is first sent to the hub and then relayed to the destination device.
- **<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Isolation</mark>:** Devices in a star network are <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">typically isolated from one another.</mark> A failure or issue with one device does not directly affect other devices in the network.
#### - **Advantages:**
    
- **<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Centralized Control</mark>:** The central hub or <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">switch provides a point of control</mark>, making it easy to manage and monitor network traffic.
- **<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Scalability</mark>:** <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Adding or removing devices from a star network is straightforward and does not affect the rest of the network.</mark>
- **<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Easy Troubleshooting</mark>:** Isolation of devices simplifies the process of identifying and resolving network issues.
- **<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Reliability</mark>:** Network <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">disruptions are localized.</mark> If one device fails, it does not impact the entire network.
#### - **Disadvantages:**
    
- **<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Single Point of Failure</mark>:** The <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">central hub or switch represents a single point of failure.</mark> If it malfunctions or loses power, the entire network can be disrupted.
- **<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Limited Fault Tolerance</mark>:** Unlike mesh or ring topologies, star topologies <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">offer limited fault tolerance.</mark> Redundant central hubs or switches may be needed for higher reliability.
- **<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Cabling Requirements</mark>:** Each <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">device requires a separate cable to connect to the central hub or switch</mark>, which can lead to increased cabling complexity.
#### - **Use Cases:**
    
- **<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Local Area Networks (LANs)</mark>:** Star topologies are <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">common in Ethernet LANs, where a switch serves as the central point for device connections.</mark>
- **<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Home Networks</mark>:** Many home networks use a star topology, with a home router or switch at the center.

- **<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Wired and Wireless LANs</mark>:** Both <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">wired and wireless networks can be configured in a star topology.</mark> In wireless LANs, the central hub is often a wireless access point.

## Switching Techniques
These mechanisms determine how data is<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;"> forwarded from the source to the destination within a network.</mark>


### Circuit Switching
    
Circuit switching is a traditional switching technique that  establishes a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">dedicated communication path between the source and destination</mark> for the entire duration of the call.

- **Advantages:** Provides constant, predictable bandwidth for voice or data transmission.
- **Disadvantages:** Inefficient for bursty or data-centric traffic, as the circuit remains open even when no data is being transmitted.
- **Use Cases:** Legacy telephone networks.

### Packet Switching
    

Packet switching divides <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">data into small packets that are transmitted independently and reassembled at the destination.</mark> The Internet primarily relies on packet switching.

- **Advantages:** Efficient use of network resources, scalability, and suitable for various types of traffic.
- **Disadvantages:** Packet loss can occur, and latency may vary.
- **Use Cases:** Internet, LANs, WANs, and most modern networks.
###  Message Switching
    
Message switching transmits <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">entire messages between nodes.</mark> Each node stores and forwards the entire message before forwarding it to the next node.

- **Advantages:** Message integrity is maintained, and messages are not broken into smaller parts.
- **Disadvantages:** Inefficient for large messages and can lead to delays when messages are rerouted.
- **Use Cases:** Rarely used in modern networks but historically found in early computer networks.

## Medium Access Control (MAC)

These protocols determine <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">how devices on a network share access to the communication medium</mark>, such as a wired Ethernet network or a wireless Wi-Fi network.

### Types
- **CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection)**
- **CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance)**
- **Token Passing**
- **Slotted ALOHA**

### **CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection)** 

This is a network protocol used in Ethernet networks to <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">manage access to a shared communication medium. </mark>It was widely used in older Ethernet networks, particularly in the <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">10BASE5 and 10BASE2</mark> variants. CSMA/CD <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">is designed to prevent and manage collisions</mark>, which occur when multiple devices try to transmit data on the same network segment simultaneously. 

#### **Operation of CSMA/CD**

1. **Carrier Sense (CS):** Devices <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">listen to the network to determine if it is idle or if other devices are currently transmitting.</mark> Before transmitting data, a device checks for the presence of a carrier signal. If the medium is in use, the device waits until it becomes idle.
    
2. **Collision Detection (CD):** If two devices happen to transmit at the same time (a collision), <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">they detect the collision by monitoring the network for a distorted signal.</mark> When a collision is detected, <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">both devices stop transmitting and enter a "backoff" mode,</mark> where they wait for a random amount of time before attempting to retransmit.

#### **Advantages of CSMA/CD**

- **<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Effective Collision Management</mark>:** CSMA/CD effectively detects and manages collisions, reducing the likelihood of continuous collisions on the network.
    
- **<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Fair Access</mark>:** It provides a <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">degree of fairness in terms of network access</mark>, as devices wait their turn and back off if a collision is detected.

#### **Disadvantages of CSMA/CD**

- **<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Less Relevant</mark>:** With the adoption of full-duplex Ethernet and modern Ethernet standards (e.g., 1000BASE-T, 10GBASE-T), CSMA/CD has <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">become less relevant.</mark> In full-duplex Ethernet, collisions are not possible because devices can transmit and receive simultaneously.
    
- **<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Inefficiency</mark>:** In modern networks, the CSMA/CD protocol introduces <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">overhead and delays</mark> without offering significant benefits. This protocol is inefficient for high-speed, switched Ethernet networks.
    
- **<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Complexity</mark>:** While it was suitable for earlier shared Ethernet networks, CSMA/CD <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">introduces complexity</mark> that is no longer needed in many network environments.

### Token Ring / Passing

#### Description

Token Ring is a LAN technology in which <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">devices are connected in a physical ring or star-wired ring topology.</mark> It is characterized by the<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> use of a token-passing protocol</mark>, where devices take turns transmitting data.
    
#### **Operation of Token Ring**

1. **<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Initialization</mark>:** When the network is first powered up or initialized, a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">token is created.</mark> The token is a small data frame that includes information about its source and destination and is passed from one device to the next.
    
2. **<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Token Passing</mark>:** The token <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">circulates around the network in a fixed order.</mark> Each device has a network interface card (NIC) that monitors the network for the presence of the token. When a device receives the token, it has the opportunity to transmit data.
    
3. **<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Data Transmission</mark>:** <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">If a device has data to transmit, it seizes the token</mark>, essentially capturing it. The device then attaches its data to the token and sends it on to the next device in the ring. The token continues to circulate, passing through each device.
    
4. **<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Destination Device</mark>:** When the token <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">reaches the destination device (the device that originally captured the token), that device removes its data and releases the token back onto the network.</mark>
    
5. **<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Empty Network</mark>:** In the absence of data to transmit,<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> the token circulates as an empty frame.</mark> This indicates that no devices have data to transmit at that moment.
#### Characteristics
    
- **<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Ring Topology</mark>:** In a traditional Token Ring network, devices are <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">physically connected in a ring.</mark> Each device has two connections: one for data transmission and one for data reception.
- **<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Token Passing</mark>:** Token Ring networks <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">use a token-passing protocol to control access to the network.</mark> <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">A "token" is passed from device to device, and only the device holding the token can transmit data.</mark> This helps avoid data collisions.
- **<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Predictable Performance</mark>:** Token Ring networks provide deterministic performance, as devices take turns transmitting data. This predictability is suitable for real-time applications.
#### Advantages
    
- **<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Deterministic Performance</mark>:** Token Ring networks offer <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">consistent and predictable data transmission</mark>, making them suitable for applications with strict timing requirements.
- **<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Low Collision Rate</mark>:** Since only one device can transmit at a time, Token Ring networks <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">have a low collision rate compared</mark> to Ethernet networks, which use a contention-based protocol.
- **<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Scalability</mark>:** Token Ring networks <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">can be expanded by adding more devices or segments to the ring.</mark>

### **CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance)**

This is a network protocol used in<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> wireless networks</mark>, including Wi-Fi, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">to manage access to a shared communication medium.</mark> Unlike CSMA/CD (used in traditional Ethernet), CSMA/CA is designed for wireless networks where collision detection is more challenging due to the nature of wireless communication.

#### **Operation of CSMA/CA**

1. **<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Carrier Sense (CS)</mark>:** Devices using CSMA/CA <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">listen to the wireless medium to determine if it is idle or if other devices are currently transmitting.</mark> Before transmitting data, a device checks for the presence of other transmissions. If the medium is busy, the device waits until it becomes idle.
    
2. **<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Collision Avoidance (CA)</mark>:** Instead of relying on collision detection, CSMA/CA <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">aims to avoid collisions altogether.</mark> When a device wishes to transmit data, it <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">sends a short request-to-send (RTS) packet to the access point (AP) or the destination device. If the AP receives the RTS packet without interference, it responds with a clear-to-send (CTS) packet to indicate that the channel is available for transmission.</mark>
    
3. **<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Transmitting Data</mark>:** Once the <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">CTS is received, the device can transmit its data. </mark>Other devices within the range of the CTS packet will be aware that the channel is reserved and will avoid transmitting during that time.
    
4. **<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Acknowledgment</mark>:** After transmitting data, <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">the receiving device sends an acknowledgment (ACK) to confirm that the data was received successfully.</mark> If the sender does not receive an ACK within a certain time, it assumes a collision has occurred and will retransmit the data.
    
#### **Advantages of CSMA/CA**

- **<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Collision Avoidance</mark>:** CSMA/CA <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">reduces the likelihood of collisions by reserving the channel with RTS/CTS packets.</mark>
    
- **<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Effective for Wireless Networks</mark>:** CSMA/CA is <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">well-suited for wireless networks, where collision detection can be challenging due to factors like signal interference and hidden nodes</mark> (devices out of each other's direct range).
    
- **<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Improved Reliability</mark>:** By using acknowledgments, CSMA/CA helps <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">ensure that transmitted data is received correctly,</mark> enhancing network reliability.
    

#### **Disadvantages of CSMA/CA**

- **<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Overhead</mark>:** The use of <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">RTS and CTS packets introduces overhead</mark> in the communication process.
    
- **<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Reduced Efficiency</mark>:** CSMA/CA can lead to <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">reduced efficiency</mark>, especially in networks with many devices contending for the channel, as devices may need to wait for their turn.
    
- **<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Suitable for Wireless Only</mark>:** CSMA/CA <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">is designed for wireless networks and is not used in wired Ethernet networks.</mark>

## Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)

This is a <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">high-speed, cell-based switching and multiplexing technology</mark> that was developed in the late 1980s and early 1990s for the transfer of voice, video, and data. 

ATM is designed to <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">provide efficient and high-throughput communication in both wide area networks (WANs) and local area networks (LANs).</mark> It uses fixed-length cells to transmit data, making it a connection-oriented, packet-switched technology.
