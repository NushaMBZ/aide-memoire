# Question 3

> [!note]
> With regard to computer networking & communications,

> [!question]
> What are the following abbreviations stand for? NIC, DSL, OSI.

1. **NIC:** Network Interface Card
    
    - NIC stands for Network Interface Card. It is a hardware component that allows a <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">computer or other device to physically connect </mark>to a network and communicate with other devices on that network. 
      
2. **DSL:** Digital Subscriber Line
    
    - DSL stands for Digital Subscriber Line. It is a broadband internet connection technology that <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">uses existing copper telephone lines to provide high-speed internet access to homes and businesses.</mark> 
      
3. **OSI:** Open Systems Interconnection
    
    - OSI stands for Open Systems Interconnection. It refers to the OSI model, which is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or networking system into seven distinct layers. 

> [!question]
> Write an example for hostname and domain name, assumed with regard to a your own business. What is the fully qualified domain name (FQDN)?

1. **Hostname:** `www`
    
    - The hostname is a label used to <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">identify a specific resource on a network.</mark> In this case, "www" is a common hostname used to represent a web server.
      
2. **Domain Name:** `techsolutions`
    
    - The domain name is the primary identifier for my business on the internet. It typically reflects the name of the business or organization. In this case, "techsolutions" is the domain name.
      
3. **Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN):** `www.techsolutions.com`
    
    - The FQDN is the complete address used to access a specific resource on the internet. It includes the hostname, domain name, and the top-level domain (TLD). In this example, `www.techsolutions.com` is the FQDN for my business's website.

> [!question]
> What is the difference between 10Base-T Ethernet and 10Base-F Ethernet? Comment on the bit rate.

10Base-T Ethernet:

- "T" in 10Base-T stands for Twisted Pair, which refers to the type of cable used for data transmission. Specifically, it uses twisted pair copper cables, typically Category 3 or Category 5 Ethernet cables.
- It uses a star topology, where each device (such as computers) is connected to a central hub or switch.
- 10Base-T Ethernet is the most common type of Ethernet used in modern local area networks (LANs) and is known for its ease of installation and flexibility.
- It operates at a maximum cable length of 100 meters between the device and the hub/switch.
  
10Base-F Ethernet:

- "F" in 10Base-F stands for Fiber, which means it uses fiber optic cables for data transmission.
- It typically uses either multi-mode or single-mode fiber optic cables for data transmission.
- 10Base-F Ethernet is less common in modern LANs compared to 10Base-T but is used in situations where longer cable runs are required or where electromagnetic interference is a concern.
- It can operate at longer distances than 10Base-T, with cable lengths extending up to several kilometers depending on the type of fiber used.

> [!question]
> Write two advantages and two disadvantages of client-server network model

1. **Centralized Management and Control:**
    - _Advantage_: In a client-server network, a central server handles authentication, access control, data storage, and resource management. 
2. **Scalability and Resource Sharing:**
    - _Advantage_: The client-server model allows for easy scalability. Additional clients can be added to the network without significantly impacting the overall performance. 

**Disadvantages:**

1. **Single Point of Failure:**
    
    - _Disadvantage_: The central server is a single point of failure in a client-server network. 
      
2. **Cost and Complexity:**
    
    - _Disadvantage_: Implementing a client-server network can be costlier and more complex than peer-to-peer networks, particularly for small-scale deployments.

# Question 4

> [!question]
> Write three important characteristics of an algorithm.

1. **Finiteness:** An algorithm must be finite, which means it must have a well-defined and limited number of steps. 
    
2. **Definiteness:** An algorithm must be well-defined and unambiguous. Each step or instruction in the algorithm must be precise and clearly stated, leaving no room for interpretation or confusion.
    
3. **Effectiveness:** An algorithm should be effective, meaning that it should be capable of solving a specific problem or performing a task in a finite amount of time using a finite amount of resources.

> [!question]
> Write a case statement (Pascal/ Pseudo) to do an appropriate operation on two given numbers with one of the operators +, -, * and /. Inputs for the case statement are num1, num2 and an operator. Remember to implement an error case against invalid operator as well.


> [!note]
> With regard to data structures, 
> 

> [!question]
> Write four preliminary data types.

1. **Integer (int):** Integer data type represents whole numbers without a fractional component. 
	1. It is used to store values like 1, -5, 100, and so on. Depending on the programming language, integers may have different sizes (e.g., int, long, short) to accommodate different ranges of values.
    
2. **Floating-Point (float/double):** Floating-point data types are used to store numbers with decimal points or fractions. 
	1. They include both "float" and "double" data types, where "double" provides higher precision than "float." Examples include 3.14, -0.001, and 2.71828.
    
3. **Character (char):** The character data type is used to store individual characters, such as letters, digits, or special symbols. 
	1. It can represent characters like 'A', '5', '%', or ' '. Char data types are often used to build strings and text-based data.
    
4. **Boolean (bool):** Boolean data types have only two possible values: true and false. 
	1. They are used for logical operations and decisions in programming. For example, a boolean variable can represent whether a condition is true (e.g., "isReady = true") or false (e.g., "isValid = false").

> [!question]
> Write two strategies (storage schemes) used to map data structures in computer memory. Which scheme is prominent to be implemented using pointer concept in Pascal?

1. **Contiguous Memory Allocation:** In this scheme, <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">data elements of a data structure are stored in consecutive memory locations.</mark> It means that each element is stored right after the previous one, creating a contiguous block of memory.
    
2. **Linked Memory Allocation:** In this scheme, data elements of a data structure are not stored in consecutive memory locations. Instead, <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">each element (node) contains a reference or pointer to the next element in the structure.</mark>
