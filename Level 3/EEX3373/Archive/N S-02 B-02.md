# Microprocessor Unit
The MPU is a <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">complex logic element that performs arithmetic, logic and control operations.</mark>

## Functions
1. Arithmetic operations (add, subtract) 
2. Logic operations (AND, OR, exclusive OR and comparisons) 
3. Simple data movement operations such as to and from memory to the processor 
4. Conditional and unconditional branch operations 
5. Manipulations of register values such as shift, rotate, etc

## **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)** 
Responsible for performing arithmetic and logic operations on data words. 

It receives two main inputs: one from the accumulator and another from the data register. It can add, subtract, or perform logic operations (e.g., AND, OR) based on control signals.

## **Accumulator** 

The accumulator is a register within the microprocessor. It serves a dual function during operation. Before an operation, it holds one of the operands, and after the operation, it holds the result. The accumulator is involved in several instructions, such as loading data from memory into the accumulator and storing data from the accumulator back into memory.

## **Data Register** 

The data register is a temporary storage location for data moving to or from the data bus. It holds data during various operations, including instruction decoding and data storage in memory.

## **Program Counter** 

The program counter controls the sequence of instructions in a program. It keeps track of the memory location from which the next instruction is to be fetched, typically incrementing sequentially.

## **Instruction Decoder**

The instruction decoder's primary role is to decode instructions fetched from memory. It examines the 16-bit instruction code and determines which operation needs to be performed.

## **Control Unit** 

The control unit generates various control signals required to execute instructions. Different instructions require different combinations of control signals to ensure that the operation described by the instruction is carried out correctly.

## **Index Register** 

The index register is a special-purpose 16-bit register that enables indexed addressing. This addressing mode is essential for more advanced memory operations and addressing schemes. 

## **Stack Pointer** 

The stack pointer is another special-purpose 16-bit register that plays a critical role in managing a section of memory as a Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) stack. This feature is valuable for handling subroutines and processing interrupts efficiently.
