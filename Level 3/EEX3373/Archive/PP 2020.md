> Explain the terms circuit switching and packet switching with examples

1. Circuit Switching: Circuit switching is an older communication method that establishes a <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">dedicated communication path between two devices for the duration of the conversation. </mark>
    
    Example: Think of a traditional landline phone call as an example of circuit switching. 
    
    Advantages:
    
    - Guaranteed, consistent quality for voice calls.
    - Simple and predictable behavior.
    
    Disadvantages:
    
    - Inefficient use of network resources when there are pauses in conversation.
    - Limited scalability for handling a large number of simultaneous connections.
      
2. Packet Switching: Packet switching is a more modern and flexible method of communication, commonly used in data networks like the internet. 
    
    Example: Imagine sending an email from your computer to a server. The email message is broken into packets, each of which carries a portion of the message along with routing information. 
    
    Advantages:
    
    - Efficient use of network resources as bandwidth is shared among multiple connections.
      
    - Scalable and suitable for handling a large number of connections simultaneously.
    
    Disadvantages:
    
    - Packet switching may introduce some delay or jitter in real-time applications like voice and video calls.
      
    - There's no guaranteed quality of service; network congestion can lead to packet loss or delays.

> IP addressing is used in computer networks to distinctly identify the networks and the devices.

> [!question]
> Compare the two addressing schemes IPv4 and IPv6

1. **Address Length:**
    
    - **IPv4:** IPv4 addresses are <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">32-bit long</mark> and typically expressed in decimal format, divided into four octets (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
    - **IPv6:** IPv6 addresses are <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">128-bit long</mark> and expressed in hexadecimal format, separated by colons (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).
2. **Address Space:**
    
    - **IPv4:** IPv4 provides around 4.3 billion unique addresses, which was sufficient in the early days of the internet but is now depleted due to the rapid growth of connected devices.
    - **IPv6:** IPv6 was introduced to address the exhaustion of IPv4 addresses. It offers an almost infinite number of unique addresses, approximately 340 undecillion (3.4 x 10^38), ensuring the scalability of the internet.
      
3. **Notation:**
    
    - **IPv4:** Expressed in dotted-decimal notation, with each octet represented by a decimal number (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
    - **IPv6:** Expressed in hexadecimal notation, with colons separating groups of four hexadecimal digits (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).
      
4. **Address Configuration:**
    
    - **IPv4:** Typically, IPv4 addresses are <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">manually configured or assigned dynamically using DHCP</mark> (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol).
    - **IPv6:** IPv6 <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">supports multiple methods of address assignment</mark>, including stateless autoconfiguration and DHCPv6, making it more versatile and efficient for network management.
      
5. **Address Types:**
    
    - **IPv4:** IPv4 includes three main address types: unicast (one-to-one communication), broadcast (one-to-all within a network segment), and multicast (one-to-many communication to a specific group).
    - **IPv6:** IPv6 simplifies address types, primarily using unicast and multicast, with no concept of broadcast. Multicast is more efficiently handled in IPv6.
      
6. **Header Complexity:**
    
    - **IPv4:** IPv4 headers are relatively complex and can lead to processing overhead on routers and switches due to the need for features like Network Address Translation (NAT) and checksum calculations.
    - **IPv6:** IPv6 headers are simplified and more efficient, which reduces processing overhead. Features like NAT are less necessary due to the vast address space.
      
7. **Security and Mobility:**
    
    - **IPv4:** IPv4 lacked built-in security features and efficient support for mobile devices.
    - **IPv6:** IPv6 incorporates improved security through IPsec integration and better support for mobile devices and mobile networks.
      
8. **Transition Mechanisms:**
    
    - **IPv4:** Transition mechanisms like NAT were introduced to deal with IPv4 address scarcity.
    - **IPv6:** IPv6 was designed as a long-term solution to address the shortcomings of IPv4, and transition mechanisms like dual-stack and tunneling are used to facilitate the migration to IPv6.

# Question 4

> [!question]
> Describe three advantages of using optical fibre cables for broadband networks.

1. **High Data Transmission Rates:**
    
    - Optical fiber cables can <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">transmit data at extremely high speeds</mark>, often measured in gigabits or even terabits per second. 
    - Fiber optics use light signals to transmit data, and since the speed of light is much faster than electrical signals in copper cables, optical fiber networks can provide faster and more consistent internet speeds.
      
2. **Low Signal Loss and High Reliability:**
    
    - Optical fibers experience minimal signal loss over long distances compared to traditional copper cables. 
    - Fiber optic cables are less susceptible to electromagnetic interference (EMI) and radio-frequency interference (RFI), which can affect the performance of copper cables. 
      
3. **Increased Bandwidth and Scalability:**
    
    - Optical fiber networks offer significantly higher bandwidth compared to copper-based networks. 
    - Fiber optics also provide scalability, allowing network operators to increase bandwidth as demand grows by upgrading the network's optical equipment and infrastructure.

> [!question]
> Explain the amplitude modulation process considering analogue sinusoidal signals with appropriate equations.

Amplitude modulation (AM) is a modulation technique used in analog communication systems to <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">transmit information by varying the amplitude of a high-frequency carrier signal in proportion to the instantaneous value of an input analog signal.</mark>

1. **Carrier Signal (c(t)):**
    
    - The carrier signal is a high-frequency, pure sinusoidal signal typically expressed as: c(t) = A_c * cos(2πf_c * t)
        
    - Where:
        
        - A_c is the amplitude of the carrier signal.
        - f_c is the frequency of the carrier signal.
        - t is time.
          
2. **Message Signal (m(t)):**
    
    - The message signal is the analog signal containing the information to be transmitted. Let's assume it's a sinusoidal signal expressed as: m(t) = A_m * cos(2πf_m * t)
        
    - Where:
        
        - A_m is the amplitude of the message signal.
        - f_m is the frequency of the message signal.
        - t is time.
          
3. **Modulated Signal (s(t)):**
    
    - The modulated signal is the result of amplitude modulation. It's obtained by multiplying the message signal with the carrier signal: s(t) = [A_c + A_m * cos(2πf_m * t)] * cos(2πf_c * t)
      
4. **AM Equation:**
    
    - Expanding the modulated signal equation: s(t) = A_c * cos(2πf_c * t) + A_m * cos(2πf_m * t) * cos(2πf_c * t)
      
5. **Frequency Components:**
    
    - The modulated signal s(t) consists of three frequency components:
        - The carrier frequency component at 2πf_c * t.
        - The original message signal component at 2πf_m * t.
        - Two sidebands at (2π(f_c + f_m) * t) and (2π(f_c - f_m) * t).
          
6. **Bandwidth Requirement:**
    
    - The bandwidth required for an AM signal is twice the maximum frequency of the message signal. In other words, it's approximately 2 * f_m.
      
7. **Demodulation:**
    
    - To recover the original message signal at the receiver, you can use an envelope detector or a diode demodulator. This process involves extracting the envelope of the AM signal.

> If there are five desktop computers to share a printer in a network, describe a suitable physical topology to connect these devices for each scenario described below.

> [!scenario]
> At a given time, only one desktop computer can communicate with the printer but able to communicate with other computers simultaneously.

A suitable physical topology to connect these devices is a **Star Topology** with a network switch.

In a Star Topology:

- Each desktop computer is directly connected to a central network switch.
- The printer is also connected to the same network switch.
- The network switch allows multiple devices to be connected and communicate simultaneously, making it suitable for scenarios where concurrent communication between computers is required.
- However, only one device at a time can communicate with the printer because the printer is connected to the same network switch and shares the same network segment.
- When a computer wants to print, it sends a print job to the printer through the switch, and the switch manages access to the printer on a first-come, first-served basis.

> [!Scenario]
> At a given time, only one desktop computer can communicate with the printer but not able to communicate with other computers simultaneously

A suitable physical topology to connect these devices is a **Bus Topology** with a print server.

In a Bus Topology:

- All desktop computers and the printer are connected to a single central cable (the bus).
- A print server is connected to the bus as well.
- Communication on the bus is sequential, meaning that only one device can transmit data at a time, and all other devices listen.
- To print, a desktop computer sends a print job to the print server.
- The print server manages the print queue and controls access to the printer. It allows only one computer to access the printer at a time.
- Other computers cannot communicate with each other while one is printing because the bus is occupied.
