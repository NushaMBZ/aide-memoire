# **Program Execution Cycle**
The fundamental cycle of a microcomputer during program execution involves two main phases: fetch and execute.

1. **<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Fetch Phase</mark>:** When the microprocessor unit (MPU) is initially started or during each cycle, it enters the fetch phase. In this phase, the MPU retrieves (fetches) the next instruction from memory.
    
2. **<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Execute Phase</mark>:** After the instruction has been fetched and decoded, the MPU switches to the execute phase. During this phase, the MPU performs the operation specified by the instruction.
