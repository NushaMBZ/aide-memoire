**Things to be considered before an application development**

- What are their problems
- How much time they spend on app
- What is their expectations
- How things are different from web/desktop
- Device fragmentation


**Mobile User Experience (UX) - why of a product**

- Mobile UX design is the design of user experiences for hand-held and wearable devices

-Designers create solutions o meet mobile users unique requirements and restrictions
-Designers focus on accessibility, discoverability and efficiency to optimize on the go interactive experiences 


_Major Components of UX_

- These are best practices and guidelines for designing a mobile user experience (UX) that focuses on optimizing the usability and overall experience for users interacting with mobile applications or websites.

1. Minimize Content - Design for minimal page-loading times (less than three seconds) and cognitive load
2. Simplify Navigation - Most users use one hand; fingertips can be large
3. Restrict User Inputs - Users become frustrated when they must continuously tap buttons. So, design to offer maximum effect for minimum interaction/effort
4. Ensure Continuity and Consistency - Let users continue where they left off and so they can switch easily between mobiles and desktops

By following these guidelines, UX designers can create mobile experiences that are user-friendly, efficient, and tailored to the specific constraints and behaviors associated with mobile usage, ultimately leading to improved user satisfaction and engagement.


**Mobile User Interface (UI) - How of a product**

- A mobile user interface is the graphical and usually touch sensitive display on a mobile device such as a smartphone or tablet that allows the user to interact with the device's apps, features and functions 

- User Interface elements usually fall into one of the following four categories 

1. Input controls
2. Navigation components
3. Informational components
4. Containers


***Stages of UI Design Process***

1. Understand customers and their values
2. Research the competition
3. Sketch out the product
4. Design the product
5. Implement the solution 
6. Evaluate the work and improve it


***Types of Application Requirements***

- **Application requirements refer to the specific criteria and functionalities that a software application must meet in order to fulfill its intended purpose.** These requirements serve as the foundation for the development, design, and testing of the application.

1. Domain Requirements

- The requirements which are characteristic of a particular category or domain of projects

2. Functional Requirements 

- Functional Requirement defines the functionality of a system or it's subsystem 
- It describe the functions a software must perform.
- A function is nothing but inputs, it's behavior and outputs. it can be a calculation, data manipulation, business process, user interaction or any other specific functionality which defines what function a system is likely to perform 

EX - if it's an e-commerce application, functional requirements might include the ability to browse products, add items to a shopping cart, and complete a purchase.

3. Non - Functional Requirements 

- Verifies the attributes of the system such as memory leaks, performance of the system
- A non functional requirements is essential to ensure the and effectiveness of the entire software system.
- Failing to meet non functional requirements can result in systems that fail to satisfy user needs

EX - non-functional requirements include response time, data encryption standards, and user interface consistency.

EX - Usability, Legal or Regulatory Requirements, Reliability and performance 


***Steps of the UX design and UI design in mobile app development***

- Creating user journey map/Mind map
- Building UX wireframe
- Building prototype
- Graphic design 
- Usability testing


***Mind Map***

- A mind map is a graphical way to represent ideas and concepts

- It is a visual thinking tool that helps structuring information, helping you to better analyze, comprehend, synthesize, recall and generate new ideas


***Building UI Design for Mobile App***

- Sketches
- Block level Designs
- Wire Frames
- Mock ups
- Prototypes


***Sketches***

- The process of creating rough, hand drawn sketches or wireframes of the UI and UX design for a application


***Block Level Designs***

- The process of breaking down a system or software application into discrete functional components or blocks

***A Block level design is something which presents all the functional parts of your application in visual format***


***Wire Frames***

- Wireframes are the blueprint for design 
- They are supposed to connect the underlying conceptual structure to the surface of website or mobile app

- A quick sketch to convey the high level concept of new product functionality
- To gain consensus and collect internal feedback on how new functionality will work
- Low fidelity


***Prototyping***

- Prototypes concentrate on the feel of the UI/UX product that one is designing
- It's more about the interaction experience
- Prototypes give you the effect of a simulator
- Interactive simulation of new product functionality
- To collect feedback by user testing the real experience 
- High fidelity
