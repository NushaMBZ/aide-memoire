***Monetizing Android Apps***

**Free Distribution Model with ads**
- The free distribution model with ads means that free versions of apps include advertisements. Developers earn money based on the click-through rate (CTR), which is the ratio of clicked ads to the total displayed. Each click generates a specific amount of revenue for the developer.

**Freemium Distribution Model**
- In the freemium distribution model, the app is free to download but offers premium content that users can purchase within the app. This model often includes in-app purchases for additional features, levels, virtual currency, or other enhancements that enhance the overall user experience.

**Paid Distribution Model**
- In the paid distribution model, users are required to pay for the app at the time of download from platforms like the Google Play Store. App developers set the price for the app, and users must pay the specified amount to access and download the app.

**Affiliate partnership Model**
- In the affiliate partnership model, content-rich apps partner with other businesses to earn revenue. The app hosts affiliate ads that direct users to external websites. By strategically aligning with various brands, the app acts as a marketing channel, promoting products and services to its users.

**Commission Model**
- In the commission model, app developers earn a commission for each transaction that occurs within the app. This model is common in marketplace, retail, and e-commerce apps that connect buyers and sellers on a single platform.

**White Labeling Model**
- In the white labeling model, app developers sell their source code to various companies with similar requirements. After purchasing the source code, these companies can customize and rebrand the app to meet their specific needs.

**Publishing to Amazon App Store**
- Developers can submit Android apps to the Amazon App Store, expanding their reach to Amazon customers. Publishing on the Amazon App Store offers improved app governance by Amazon and the opportunity to generate additional revenue from Android apps.


***Monetizing IOS Apps***

- In iOS app monetization, developers can earn through in-app advertising, paid apps, and built-in subscriptions. Subscriptions involve offering all app functions for a monthly fee, often with a free trial or freemium features to allow users to try the app before committing to a subscription.

Freemium/ Free trial
- In the freemium/free trial model, users can access the complete, full-featured app for a limited time, usually 30 days. After the trial period, the app expires, and users must pay to continue using it. This model allows users to experience the app's full functionality before making a purchasing decision.



***What is Mobile Advertising***

- Mobile advertising refers to ads and web pages that are designed to be easily viewed on small mobile devices and tablets. Modern marketers use various sophisticated designs and rich media interactivity to create mobile-friendly ads and websites, which can enhance brand awareness and generate more revenue. Ads play a significant role in the monetization of mobile platforms.



***Defining the Success Metrics***

- Defining success metrics for mobile ads involves determining Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics. Developers can choose from six popular metrics to measure the success of their mobile ads.

CPM
- stands for cost per Mille, meaning "cost per 1000 impressions." In simple terms, it indicates the cost of publishing an ad a thousand times on a website for users to see. "Mille" in CPM is the Latin word for "thousands."

CTR
- CTR (Click Through Rate) measures the success of online ads by calculating the percentage of people who click on the ad to visit the linked website.

CPC
- CPC (Cost Per Click) is a metric that calculates the average number of times users click on an ad. It's commonly used in Google AdWords to help advertisers manage their campaign budgets and assess performance.

CPI
- CPI (Cost Per Install) refers to campaigns in mobile applications where publishers place digital ads across various media to maximize app installations. Advertisers are charged a bid or fixed rate only when the app is installed.

CPL
- CPL (Cost Per Lead) refers to the costs associated with advertising campaigns aimed at obtaining and converting leads. To calculate CPL, advertisers divide their total advertising cost for a campaign or ad group by the number of leads generated.

CPV
- CPV (Cost Per View) is a pricing model where video advertisements are charged based on the number of views or interactions an ad receives. A view is counted when a viewer watches 30 seconds of the video ad or engages with the ad, whichever comes first.
