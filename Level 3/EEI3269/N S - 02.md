## Basic Parts of mobile applications

- ### Services
	Services contain business logic and data sources for apps, which are communicated through an Application Programming Interface (API), similar to a cord plugged into Neo's head.
- ### Libraries
    Libraries are third-party code packages used by app developers to enable specific functionality without having to create it from scratch.
- ### Codebase 
    <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Developers create code to build app features, functionality, and libraries, referencing services' APIs and implementing user interface and interactions as designed by the designer.</mark>
- ### User Experience and Interface :
    <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Designers are responsible for creating the app's appearance, feel, and experience, </mark>which significantly impact the user's perception of it.

## Mobile App Architecture

- #### Presentation Layer:
    The presentation layer comprises UI components and UI process components, defining the app's presentation logic and user experience.
- #### Business Layer: 
    The business layer is responsible for showcasing the business identity to the user through workflows, business entities, and components.
- #### Data Layer :
    The data layer comprises data-related components such as access components, helpers, utilities, and service agents.

## Types of Mobile applications
- #### Native mobile apps  :
	<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Native mobile apps are designed for specific mobile platforms like iOS and Android, typically using the provided SDKs to fully utilize device capabilities.</mark>

  #### User Experience -
    A responsive website is designed to be flexible and adapt to the screen layout, ensuring an optimal user experience.      
#### Cost Effective 
   RWD offers a cost-effective solution with a single source code version and content management system for content updates.


    

    The URL structure will remain consistent across all devices, enhancing search engine visibility and rankings, eliminating the need to market multiple websites.
    The website's user-friendly accessibility on various devices can significantly boost sales and conversion rates.
- #### Hybrid apps :
    These apps can be developed using web technologies such as JavaScript and can also partially leverage the device capabilities using a web to native layer.
