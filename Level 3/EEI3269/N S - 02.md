## Basic Parts of mobile applications

- ### Services
	Services contain business logic and data sources for apps, which are communicated through an Application Programming Interface (API), similar to a cord plugged into Neo's head.
- ### Libraries
    Libraries are third-party code packages used by app developers to enable specific functionality without having to create it from scratch.
- ### Codebase 
    <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Developers create code to build app features, functionality, and libraries, referencing services' APIs and implementing user interface and interactions as designed by the designer.</mark>
- ### User Experience and Interface :
    <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Designers are responsible for creating the app's appearance, feel, and experience, </mark>which significantly impact the user's perception of it.

## Mobile App Architecture
   <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Mobile app architecture is a set of structural elements along with their interfacesÂ that compose the system.
