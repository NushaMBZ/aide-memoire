## Basic Parts of mobile applications

- ### Services
	Services contain business logic and data sources for apps, which are communicated through an Application Programming Interface (API), similar to a cord plugged into Neo's head.
- ### Libraries
    Libraries are third-party code packages used by app developers to enable specific functionality without having to create it from scratch.
