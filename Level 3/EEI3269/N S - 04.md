# Introduction to Mobile Operating System


***What is an OS***

- an OS handles all hardware & software resources of the computer
- it works as a communication medium between various components of computer


***Function of an OS***

- Peripheral Device Management
- Data File Management
- Memory Management
- Process Management


***Peripheral Device Management***

- The process of controlling and administering the various peripheral devices connected to a computer or a network
- The unit which keeps tracks of systems is known as I/O controller
- I/O controller identifies which assigns process to devices for specific duration and allocates and de allocates process to devices in an effective way

***Data File Management***

- The process of manipulating files in computer system, its management includes the process of creating, modifying and deleting files

-It helps to create new files in computer system and placing them at the specific location
-It helps in easily and quickly locating files in computer system
-It makes the process of sharing of the files among different users
-It helps to store the files in separate folders known as directories
-It helps the user to modify the data of files or to modify the file in the directories

***Memory Management***

- The task of subdividing the memory of multiprogramming computer among different processes is called as memory management
- Memory management is a method of OS to manage operations between main memory and disk during process execution

-Allocate and de-allocate memory before and after process execution
-To keep track of used memory space by processes
-To minimize fragmentation issues
-To proper utilization of main memory
-To maintain data integrity while executing of process

***Process Management***

- Process management involves various task like creation, scheduling, terminating of processes and a dead lock
- It is the job of OS to manage all the running process of the system.
- It handles operation by performing task like process scheduling and such as resource allocation


***Mobile Operating System***

- OS have been developed to enable users to use phones in much the same way as PC were used
- It allows the devices to run application and other programs
- Mobile OS usually including most of the following considered essentials
	-a touch screen, Bluetooth, video camera, Wi-Fi, music player, voice recorder 

- These OS managing the resources of the devices and memory when they are being used for multi tasking


***Layers of Mobile OS***

- Infrastructure Layer
	-This layer is the foundation that supports all of the other tiers of the model
	-The majority of the functional components at this layer are owned operated by a mobile carrier or infrastructure provider

- Hardware Layer
	-A physical unit that is typically under the direct control of an end user

- Operating System Layer
	-This layer corresponds to the software running on a device that allows communicates between the hardware and the application tiers 

- Application Layer
	-The application tier resides at the top of the mobile security stack and is the layer that the end user directly interfaces
	-The application layer is identified by running processes that utilize application programming interfaces provided by the OS layer as an entry point into the rest if the stack


***Layers of Mobile Operating Systems (from Chat GPT)***

1. **Hardware Layer:** This layer comprises the physical components of the mobile device, such as the processor, memory, storage, sensors, and other hardware components.
    
2. **Operating System Layer:** The operating system (OS) layer is responsible for managing the hardware and software resources of the mobile device. It provides a platform for the execution of applications and includes essential components like the kernel, device drivers, and system libraries.
    
3. **Infrastructure Layer:** This layer typically refers to the network infrastructure that enables communication between the mobile device and various other networks, such as cellular networks, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. It also encompasses the protocols and technologies that facilitate data transmission and connectivity.
    
4. **Application Layer:** The application layer consists of the various software applications that users interact with on their mobile devices. These applications can range from pre-installed system apps to third-party applications downloaded from app stores. Examples include web browsers, social media apps, productivity tools, and games.


***Android OS***
- The Android OS is the most popular OS. It is a mobile OS based on the Linux kernel and open source software

***IOS***
- The IOS was developed by the Apple inc for the use on its device. It is a very secure OS. The IOS OS is not available for any other mobiles
