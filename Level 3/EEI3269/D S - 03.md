***Why are the tools needed for App development***

- building a mobile app is not a simple task that you can create within some hours
- for implement application you need several things
- one of them is a mobile application development tool

-tools help to make the application development process easier
-provide various IDEs
-provide code free development
-templates
-API
-data synchronization
-analytics
-faster app development
-simplifies the integration process with backend services
-ensures a visual development environment and features
