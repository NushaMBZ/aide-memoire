    - Driving incremental revenue through user stickiness  
    - Customer conversion  
    - User loyalty through targeted and personalized offers  
    
- App architecture  
    - Native vs Hybrid bs Web based requirements  
    - Middleware requirements for centralized configuration  
    - Offline vs Online capability for storing data  
    
- App development principles  
    - UX through richer controls and interactive components  
    - Compatibility on various devices and platforms  
    - Performance for each screen and task  
    - Security for data  
    - Productivity enhancement tools  
    
- Target Users  
    - Consumers for B2C apps  
    - Business for Business to Business (B2B) apps  
    - Partners for B2B apps  
    - Employees for Business to Employee (B2E) apps  
    
- Testing  
    - Device testing  
    - Performance testing  
    - Various testing scenarios  
  
  
***The main challenges in mobile app strategy***  
  
- Diversity of devices and heterogeneous technologies  
- Security  
- User Experience  
- Network  
- Compliance to diverse standards  
  
  
***Types of Application***  
  
1. PC Based Application  
  
- Standalone PC Application : an application that runs locally on the device and doesn't require anything else to be functional. it doesn't need an internet connection and any other services installed  
  
EX : Utility programs such as word process, calculators, and media players  
  
- Client Server Application : Client requests services from the server by calling functions in the server application.  
  
: The client program would get input from the end user and would submit the details to the server software through dedicated session  
  
EX : Database software, network games, banking software, network file system  
  
  
2. WEB Based Application  
  
- Internet enabled application that are mainly rendered on desktop browsers are categorized as web applications  
- Most of the the modern web application follow layered MODEL-VIEW-CONTROLLER (MVC) architecture  
- Modern Web Application use Representational State Transfer (REST) based light weight services.  
  
**The Key Layers of the MVC**  
  
- **Presentation Layer** (View Layer) : UX components such as portlets, widgets, pages, UI modules, buttons and forms.  
  
- **Business Layer** : Layer consists of business components which implement business logic and business rules.  
  
- **Data Layer** (Model Layer) : This layer mainly consists of persistence handling components such as database access components, Data access objects (DAO), Query Components, Object Rational Mapping (ORM) frameworks  
  
  
***Evolution of Mobile Based Application***  
  
1. Embedded systems  
2. Device specific apps  
3. OS specific apps  
4. Cloud based apps  
  
***Content and Protocol in Mobility***  
  
1. Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) :  
  - It provides specifications and rules for wireless communication devices such as smartphones. WAP is optimized for low memory, low bandwidth mobile devices  
  
2. Representational State Transfer (REST) :  
  - Responsive mobile web applications communicate with server using light weight REST calls. Normally JSON data is used in REST service for data exchange.  
  
  
***Android***  
  
- open source mobile development platform that is based on java and is maintained by google  
- Zero development cost  
- open source  
- Multi platform support  
- Multi carrier support  
- open distribution model  
- java and kotlin using as programming languages  
- Android development needs Android SDK, libraries, emulator and android studio IDE  
  
  
***IOS***  
  
- IOS is the mobile OS for Apple devices  
- IOS is the second most popular mobile OS  
- Unix derived OS  
- The development on IOS happens using objective C  
- IOS development includes IOS SDK(Xcode), IOS simulator, Xcode IDE and other frameworks for building IOS apps
