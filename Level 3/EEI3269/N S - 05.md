# Basics of Android

- an open source mobile OS developed by Google
- it is a Linux based OS that provide core services, network stack and a driver model
- offers a unified approach to application development for mobile devices which means developers need only develop for Android, and their applications should able to run on different devices powered by Android
- offers a wide range of libraries that enable the app developers to build different applications


***Advantages of Android***

- open source
- Larger developer and community reach
- increased marketing
- inter app integration
- reduced cost of development
- higher success ratio
- rich development environment


***Disadvantages of Android***

- complex coding
- challenging animation
- vulnerability to malware
- battery drain
- persistence ads
- security risk
- device fragmentation


***Android Memory Management***

- Android utilizes a Linux-based OS with a capable 2.6.x kernel, proficient in handling diverse tasks. The stripped-down Linux kernel manages fundamental operations like process, I/O, and memory management.

- Each application in Android has its own runtime and virtual machine, which is atypical. The Android runtime oversees process lifecycles, ensuring application responsiveness by halting and terminating processes as needed to prioritize resources for higher-priority apps.


***The Dalvik Virtual Machine***

- It is defined as one of the crucial element of Android. rather using a traditional JVM like Java ME
- Utilizes its own customized VM designed to manage multiple instances on a single device.
- Function of the Dalvik VM
	-Uses the Linux kernel to manage low level functionalities 
	-security and memory management
	-manage hardware and system service access
	-provides an abstraction layer to developers
	-executes executable files

- Function of the Dalvik VM from **CHAT GPT**
	-utilizing the Linux kernel
	-middle tier fragment
	-abstraction layer
	-efficient execution



**Google decided to replace Dalvik Virtual Machine by Android Run Time (ART)** 

- ART is the managed runtime used by application and some system services on Android.
- ART and Dalvik were originally created specifically for the android project.
- The most significant change from Dalvik to ART is that Dalvik is based on Just in Time(JIT) compilation while ART is based on Ahead of Time(AOT)

-Compilation performance
-Battery Life
-Installation Time
-Storage
