## Employees Trust Fund Act No 46 of 1980 (ETF)

ETF is designed to provide <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">non-contributory benefits to employees when they cease to be employed.</mark>

Unlike the Employees' Provident Fund (EPF) where both employers and employees make contributions, the ETF provides <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">benefits without requiring contributions from employees.</mark> Instead, the employer is responsible for contributing to the fund.

**Frequency of Benefits:** Under this act, employees are eligible to receive non-contributory benefits from the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">ETF every five years</mark>, provided they cease to be employed during that period. The benefits are intended to provide financial support to employees during periods of unemployment.

**Employer's Contribution:** The employer is mandated to <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">contribute 3 percent (3%) of the employee's basic salary</mark> to the Employees Trust Fund. This contribution is made on behalf of the employee and is meant to provide financial assistance to the employee when they are no longer employed.

**Coverage:** The ETF covers <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">all employees who are also covered by the Employees' Provident Fund (EPF)</mark>. In other words, if an employee is eligible for EPF benefits, they are also eligible for the non-contributory benefits provided by the ETF.

**Benefits on Ceasing Employment:** When an employee <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">ceases to be employed</mark>, they may apply for benefits from the ETF. The fund provides financial assistance during periods of unemployment or job loss.

# The Payment of Gratuity Act No 12 of 1983
