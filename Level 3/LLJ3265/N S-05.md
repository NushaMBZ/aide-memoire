# Basic Concepts in Constitutional Law

This topic covers **Doctrine of Separation of Powers**, **Rule of Law**, **Supremacy of  Parliament and Independence of the Judiciary**.

The main **function** of the Constitution is to  <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">ensures the rule of law in the country and protect the individual’s rights and  fundamental freedoms.</mark>

## The Doctrine of Separation of Powers 

The **doctrine of separation power** means that <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">the powers of main organs of the State such as the legislature, the executive and the judiciary must be clearly described in the  Constitution of the country.</mark>

The present constitution sets out the framework for the governance of a country.

**Features of the framework**
- the Power to make laws; and  (legislative)
- the Power to carry out those laws; and  (executive)
- the power to decide whether those laws have been obeyed or  broken (judiciary)

The Constitutions of modern  democracies, recognizing this doctrine of separation of Powers, <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">establish  different institutions to exercise the three Powers</mark>: The **legislature** to *make  laws*, the **executive** to *administer them* and the **Courts** to *adjudicate* upon  them.

The doctrine is useful in stating the need for  different organs to perform the different functions, but these organs and  functions do, and must, interrelate to some extent. They cannot operate in  isolation.

> [!note]
> the doctrine of separation of powers is indeed one of  fundamental importance in modern governments, even though it might not  be possible to adhere to it rigidly in the world of practical politics, and even  though no constitution can ensure a complete insulation of each of the three  branches of government from the others.

## Rule of Law

In general the concept that <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">all individuals and institutions, including government officials and authorities, are subject to and accountable under the law.</mark>

Based on Dicey's definition rule of law could be defined in the following terms.

> That no man is punishable or can lawfully be made to suffer in  body or goods except for a distinct breach or law established in  the ordinary legal manner before the ordinary Courts of the  Land

**Article 27(2) of the Constitution**

> Not only that with us No man is above the law, but that  everyman, whatever be his rank or condition is subject to the  ordinary law of the realm and amenable to the jurisdiction of the  ordinary tribunals.

**Article  13(5) and Article 105(1) of the Constitution.**

> That the constitution is pervaded by the rule of law on the  ground that the general principles of the Constitution (as for  example, the right to personal liberty, or the right of public  meeting) are the result of judicial decisions determining the  rights of private persons in particular cases brought before the Courts.

## Supremacy of Parliament

The legislative Supremacy of Parliament means that  <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Parliament can pass any law on any topic affecting any person and that there  are no fundamental laws which Parliament cannot amend or repeal in the  same way as ordinary legislation.</mark> 

> The parliament, as the supreme legislative body, holds the highest authority to enact, amend, and repeal laws within the jurisdiction of the country.

Blackstone says that Parliament, “<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">has sovereign and uncontrollable  authority in the making, enlarging, conforming, restraining, abrogating,  repealing, reviving and expanding of laws concerning matters of all possible  denominations, ecclesiastical or temporal, civil, military, maritime or  criminal ……</mark>” 

## Legal Connotation of Parliamentary Supremacy

Fundamental propositions that embody the concept of the sovereignty (supremacy) of Parliament in the context of the British constitutional system.

- **Parliament is the Supreme Law-Making Authority**
	- Parliament is the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">highest and ultimate authority</mark> in the legal system. 
- **No Parliament Can Bind a Future Parliament**
	- **No Parliament** can pass laws that would <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">limit the legislative authority of future Parliaments</mark>. 
- **No Person or Body Can Override or Set Aside Parliament's Legislation**
	- **No external entity**, such as an individual, organization, or court, can <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">override or invalidate the laws enacted by Parliament.</mark>

Legal connotation of the  concept is contained in the following eight propositions.  

- Parliament has the power to make or unmake any law  whatsoever.
- Parliament is not bound by its predecessors.  
- Parliament recognized no rival legislative authority.
- Parliament acts are not subject to judicial Review.
- Parliament is not bound by International Law.
- Parliament is not bound by morality.
- There are no substantive limitations to the Powers of Parliament.
- There are no Procedural limitations to the powers of Parliament.

**Limitations to Parliamentary Supremacy**
- The legal concept of parliamentary supremacy exists, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">practical limitations</mark> do exist in practice.
- Sir Ivor Jennings suggested that parliamentary supremacy <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">might be a legal fiction</mark> due to these <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">practical limitations.</mark>

**Comparing British Parliament and Ceylon Parliament**
- *British Parliament's powers have historically grown* over time, while *Ceylon Parliament's powers were defined by a written constitution.*
- British Parliament consistently *widened its powers*, while Ceylon Parliament's powers were *defined by interpreting constitutional documents.*
- *British Courts don't review Acts of Parliament*, while *Ceylon Courts reviewed certain Acts.*
- The British Constitution emphasizes Parliament's supremacy, whereas the *Ceylon Parliament's powers were subordinate to judicial review.*
- The British Parliament's predominant characteristic is its *supremacy*, while the Ceylon Parliament had certain limitations due to judicial review.

**Parliamentary Supremacy in the 1972 Ceylon Constitution**
- The National State Assembly (NSA) under the 1972 Ceylon Constitution had substantial legislative power. It could make or revoke any law, its laws were not subject to judicial review or international obligations, and it had no recognized legislative rival. Procedural limitations existed but didn't impact legislative supremacy, with only specific limitations mentioned in section 44.

**Evolution of Parliamentary Supremacy in Sri Lanka:**
- The legislative power of the present Parliament has been reduced under the 1978 Constitution. While it can still make and change laws, substantive limitations (Article 83) and other considerations (Article 75 provisos, Article 157) impact its authority.

## Independence of the Judiciary

Judicial independence is a logical outcome of the separation of powers and is closely linked to the rule of law.

- The judiciary's core role is to impartially resolve disputes based on the law.
- Judicial independence ensures that <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">judges are not influenced by improper pressures or external factors in their decision-making process.</mark>
- Courts serve as a final resort for citizens seeking redress from executive actions, legislative decisions, and unconstitutional bills.

**Role of Judiciary as Safeguard**:
The judiciary acts as a sentinel overseeing government operations to ensure citizens are not harmed.

- Maintaining a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">distinct separation from other branches of government is crucial to preserving the judiciary's integrity.</mark>
- Judges are appointed rather than elected, which underscores the need for higher standards of integrity.

**Constitutional Provisions on Judicial Independence:**

- The constitution explicitly safeguards judicial independence in Article 116.
- Judges and individuals with judicial powers are protected from interference, except by superior courts or individuals authorized by law.

**Immunity and Contempt of Court:**
- Judges enjoy immunity from legal proceedings for actions taken within their jurisdiction.
- Contempt of court rules reinforce the status and independence of the judiciary.
- Contempt of court involves actions that disrupt court proceedings, undermine court authority, or interfere with justice administration.
- Even lower-level courts have the power to punish contemptuous acts committed within their premises.

## The Sri Lankan Constitution

The Sri Lankan Constitution is the supreme law of the country which has had various constitutions before and after gaining independence. Pre-independence constitutions include those of 1833, 1920, 1931, and 1946.

**1972 and 1978 Constitutions**
- The first Sri Lankan Constitution was adopted in 1972, marking the country's complete break from British allegiance.
- The 1972 Constitution was replaced by the 1978 Constitution, both referred to as "autochthonous" or "home grown" as they were created solely by elected representatives of Sri Lanka.
**Preamble and Fundamental Principles**
- The <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">preamble of the Constitution</mark> outlines the foundational principles of freedom, equality, justice, human rights, and the independence of the judiciary.
- Chapter I of the Constitution covers general provisions about the people, the state, and sovereignty.
- Article 3 defines the five principal components of sovereignty, including legislative, executive, and judicial powers, fundamental rights, and the franchise.

**Separation of Powers and Shift from 1972 Constitution:**
- The Constitution incorporates a degree of separation of powers, marking a departure from the concentration of power in the legislature under the 1972 Constitution.
- The 1978 Constitution shifts away from the traditional Westminster-style government, introducing a hybrid system combining presidential and parliamentary elements.
