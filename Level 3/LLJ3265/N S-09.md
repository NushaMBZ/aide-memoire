# Vitiating Factors of Contract

Vitiating factors are <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">circumstances or elements that can render a contract void or voidable.</mark>

## Mistake

If both parties to a contract were <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">mistaken about a fundamental aspect of the contract</mark> (e.g., the subject matter or price), the contract may be void. The mistake must be genuine and not due to negligence.

### Types of Mistakes

There are three main types of mistakes that can impact the validity of a contract:

#### Common Mistake

Common mistake, also known as mutual mistake, occurs when <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">both parties to a contract are mistaken about the same fundamental aspect of the contract.</mark> This could be a mistake about the subject matter, the existence of the subject matter, or the terms of the contract itself.

#### Unilateral Mistake

Unilateral mistake occurs when <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">only one party to the contract is mistaken about a fundamental aspect of the contract.</mark> In this case, the other party is aware of the mistake or is not mistaken about the same issue.

#### Mistake as to Identity (Identity Mistake)
   
An identity mistake occurs when <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">a party makes a mistake about the identity of the other contracting party.</mark> This often arises in cases involving contracts with third parties or intermediaries.

## Misrepresentation

When <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">one party makes a false statement or conceals material information</mark>, inducing the other party to enter into the contract, it can be considered misrepresentation. If the misled party can prove the misrepresentation, they may have grounds to void the contract or seek damages.

### Types of Misrepresentations

#### Fraudulent Misrepresentation
 
Fraudulent misrepresentation is the most serious type of misrepresentation. It involves a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">deliberate and intentional false statement made with the knowledge that it is false or with reckless disregard for its truth.</mark>

#### Negligent Misrepresentation

Negligent misrepresentation occurs when <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">a party makes a false statement without the intent to deceive but does so negligently</mark>, meaning they should have known the statement was false or misleading.

#### Innocent Misrepresentation

Innocent misrepresentation occurs when <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">a party makes a false statement without knowledge</mark> that it is false or without negligence. In such cases, there is no intent to deceive.

## Duress

If one party <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">is forced or coerced into entering a contract against their will</mark>, the contract can be voided due to duress. This typically involves threats, violence, or some form of undue pressure.

## Undue Influence

Contracts can be voided if <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">one party exerts excessive influence over the other</mark>, which affects the weaker party's free will and judgment. This often occurs in situations of trust and confidence.

## Illegality

If the <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">subject matter or purpose of a contract is illegal</mark> under Sri Lankan law, the contract is void. This could involve contracts related to illegal activities or violating public policy.

### Contracts Prohibited by Statute

Contracts that are <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">expressly prohibited by statutes or laws</mark> in Sri Lanka are considered illegal. 

> [!example]
> the Rubber Control Ordinance makes it unlawful to sell or purchase rubber in excess of a prescribed quantity unless the person involved is a licensed dealer. Any contracts that violate such statutory prohibitions would be illegal under Sri Lankan law.

### Contracts Prohibited by Common Law

Contracts that <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">contravene established common law principles</mark> are also considered illegal. Common law principles include legal precedents developed by courts over time. If a contract goes against established common law principles, it may be deemed illegal. 

> [!example]
> Contracts that are unconscionable or against principles of fairness and equity can be considered illegal under common law.


### Contracts Contrary to Public Policy

Contracts that are <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">contrary to public policy or morality</mark> are considered illegal in Sri Lanka. These are agreements that go against the fundamental principles and values upheld by society or that are deemed to have a harmful or detrimental impact on the public. 

> [!example] 
> These may include contracts that encourage discrimination, exploitation, or other unethical practices.

## Lack of Capacity

Contracts may be voidable if <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">one of the parties lacks the capacity to contract</mark>. This includes situations where one party is a minor, mentally incapacitated, or under the influence of drugs or alcohol.

## Unconscionability

If a contract is <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">highly one-sided and unfairly favors one party over the other, it can be voided as unconscionable.</mark> This often involves contracts with oppressive or oppressive terms.

## Breach of Contract

While not a vitiating factor, <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">a material breach of the contract by one party can give the other party the right to void the contract or seek damages.</mark>
