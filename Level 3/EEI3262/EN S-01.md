# Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

This is a software application or platform that provides <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">comprehensive tools and features</mark> to help software developers <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">create, edit, debug, and manage computer programs</mark> and applications.

# Constructor

A constructor is a special type of <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">method that is used to initialize objects of classes when they are created.</mark> 

# Java Virtual Machine (JVM)

The JVM is a software-based execution environment that <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">interprets or compiles Java bytecode into machine code</mark> and provides essential features like memory management, security, and platform independence.

# Refactoring

This is the process of <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">improving and restructuring existing code to make it cleaner, more maintainable, and efficient</mark> without changing its external behavior.

# Object Oriented Programming

It is a approach that structures code around objects, which are <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">instances of classes, and defines their attributes and behaviors</mark>, promoting code organization, reusability, and modeling of real-world entities.


# Just in Time

A Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler is a part of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">translates Java bytecode (an intermediate representation of Java code) into machine code right before the code is executed.</mark>

# Bytecode

Bytecode is like a set of <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">instructions written in a special language that's used as an intermediary step between Java source code and the computer's native language.</mark>

# Method Overriding

Method overriding means there are <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">two methods with the same name - one in the parent class and another in the child class.</mark>

# Method Overloading

Method overloading is a feature that allows <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">a class to have multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.</mark>

# Interfaces

An interface is like <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">a contract or a set of rules that a class must follow.</mark> It defines a list of methods that a class that implements the interface must provide.

# Access Modifiers

Access modifiers are <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">keywords used to control the visibility or accessibility of classes, methods, variables,</mark> and other class members.
