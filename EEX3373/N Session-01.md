# Computer Models
## Computer Architectures
It is the design<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;"> and organization of the components and subsystems</mark> that make up a computer system.

## Von Neumann Model
![[Pasted image 20230912170339.png]]

This architecture serves as the foundation for most modern computers and is characterized by several key components and principles:

1. **Central Processing Unit (CPU):**
    
    - The CPU is the "brain" of the computer and is responsible for executing instructions.
    - It consists of an <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">arithmetic logic unit</mark> (ALU) for performing mathematical and logical operations and a control unit for managing the execution of instructions.
2. **Memory:**
    
    - The von Neumann architecture includes a <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">single, unified memory system</mark> that <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">stores both data and instructions.</mark>
    - This memory is often <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">organized into distinct cells or addresses, each holding a fixed amount of data</mark> (usually expressed in bits or bytes).
3. **Stored Program Concept:**
    
    - A fundamental feature of the von Neumann architecture is the idea that both <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">data and program instructions are stored in memory.</mark>
    - This allows programs to be easily modified and manipulated as data, leading to the concept of a "stored program."
4. **Instruction Set:**
    
    - The CPU understands a specific set of instructions, known as the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">instruction set architecture</mark> (ISA).
    - These instructions define the operations that the CPU can perform, such as arithmetic operations, data movement, and branching.
5. **Fetching and Execution Cycle:**
    
    - The von Neumann machine operates in a sequential manner, following a fetch-decode-execute cycle.
    - In this cycle, the CPU fetches an instruction from memory, decodes it to determine the operation to be performed, and then executes the instruction.
6. **Control Unit:**
    
    - The <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">control unit manages the flow of data and instructions between the CPU and memory.</mark>
    - It also controls <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">the operation of other hardware components</mark>, such as input/output devices.
7. **Input/Output (I/O) Devices:**
    
    - I/O devices, such as keyboards, displays, and storage devices, are used to interact with the external world and exchange data with the computer.
8. **Sequential Execution:**
    
    - Instructions are <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">executed sequentially,</mark> one after the other, unless there is a branch or jump instruction that alters the program's flow.
9. **Stored Data and Instructions:**
    
    - Data and instructions are <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">indistinguishable in memory and are manipulated using the same set of operations,</mark> which is a characteristic of the von Neumann architecture.
10. **Conditional Branching:**
    
    - The CPU supports conditional branching, allowing the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">program to make decisions based on the outcome of previous instructions</mark> (e.g., if-then-else statements).


## Harvard Architecture

![[Pasted image 20230912170427.png]]

The Harvard architecture is an alternative computer architecture design that differs from the more common von Neumann architecture. The Harvard architecture <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">separates the storage and processing of instructions and data</mark>, offering several advantages over the von Neumann architecture. Here are the key characteristics and features of the Harvard architecture:

1. **Separate Instruction and Data Memory:**
    
    - In the Harvard architecture, there are <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">two distinct memory units</mark>: <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">one for storing program instructions (instruction memory) and another for storing data </mark>(data memory).
    - This separation allows the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">CPU to fetch an instruction and read or write data simultaneously</mark>, improving overall processing speed.
2. **Parallel Data Access:**
    
    - One of the primary advantages of the Harvard architecture is the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">ability to access instruction and data memory in parallel.</mark> This means that the CPU can retrieve an instruction and perform a data access operation simultaneously.
    - In contrast, the von Neumann architecture typically <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">alternates between fetching instructions and accessing data from a single memory unit</mark>, which can introduce bottlenecks.
3. **Program and Data Independence:**
    
    - Because instructions and data are stored in <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">separate memory spaces</mark>, the Harvard architecture offers greater independence between program and data operations. This can simplify the design and reduce the risk of unintended interactions.
4. **Increased Throughput:**
    
    - The Harvard architecture can achieve <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">higher throughput for certain types of applications</mark>, particularly those that involve heavy instruction fetches or data transfers.
    - It is often used in embedded systems, digital signal processors (DSPs), and microcontrollers where real-time processing and efficiency are critical.
5. **Complex Instruction Set Computer (CISC):**
    
    - Some CISC microprocessors, such as the Atmel AVR family, employ a Harvard architecture design to optimize instruction fetch and execution.
6. **Reduced Instruction Fetch Overheads:**
    
    - In the von Neumann architecture, instruction fetches and data accesses can compete for the same memory bus, potentially causing delays. In the Harvard architecture, this contention is reduced or eliminated.
7. **Code Security:**
    
    - Separating instruction and data memory can enhance code security, making it more difficult for certain types of attacks to manipulate program instructions.
8. **Complex Memory Management:**
    
    - Implementing the Harvard architecture can be more complex than the von Neumann architecture, as it requires separate buses and memory units for instructions and data.
