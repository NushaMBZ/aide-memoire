> Name two basic computer network models. By preparing a table, compare the two models in terms of centralisation and scalability.

Two basic computer network models are the **Client-Server Model** and the **Peer-to-Peer Model**. Below is a table comparing these two models in terms of centralization and scalability:

|Aspect|Client-Server Model|Peer-to-Peer Model|
|---|---|---|
|Centralization|Centralized architecture with a dedicated server.|Decentralized architecture with no central server.|
|Control and Authority|Central server has control and authority over resources and data.|Equal peers share control and authority, no central entity.|
|Scalability|Typically more scalable for large networks by adding more servers or upgrading server hardware.|Scalability can be limited, especially for very large networks, due to the absence of centralized resources.|
|Resource Management|Central server manages and controls network resources, making resource allocation and management more efficient.|Each peer manages its resources, which can be less efficient in terms of resource allocation and control.|
|Fault Tolerance|Central server can be a single point of failure, impacting the entire network if it fails.|Resilient to server failures as there is no single point of failure.|
|Complexity|Typically, central servers require more setup and maintenance, resulting in a more complex network structure.|Simpler network structure as there is no central entity, but it can lead to complexities in peer discovery and resource management.|

> [!question]
> What do the following abbreviations stand for? NIC, HTTP, ADSL

1. **NIC:** Network Interface Card
    
    - A Network Interface Card (NIC) is a hardware component that allows a computer or other device to physically connect to a network and communicate with other devices on that network.
      
2. **HTTP:** Hypertext Transfer Protocol
    
    - HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. HTTP is an application layer protocol used for transferring web pages, images, videos, and other resources between a web server and a web browser. 
      
3. **ADSL:** Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line
    
    - ADSL stands for Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line. It is a type of broadband internet connection technology that uses existing copper telephone lines to provide high-speed internet access to homes and businesses. 

> [!question]
> Write the access server type for each of HTTP, FTP.

HTTP and FTP are both application layer protocols used for different types of data transfer over the internet.

1. **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):**
    
    - HTTP services are provided by web servers.
    - Web servers, such as Apache, Nginx, Microsoft IIS, and others, handle incoming HTTP requests and serve web content, including HTML pages, images, videos, and more.
    - HTTP is the protocol used to access websites and web applications, and you access them through web servers.
2. **FTP (File Transfer Protocol):**
    
    - FTP services are provided by FTP servers.
    - FTP servers, like FileZilla Server, ProFTPD, vsftpd, and others, manage file transfers between clients and the server.
    - FTP is used for uploading and downloading files to and from a server, and you access FTP services through FTP clients.

> [!question]
> Name the most secure but expensive type of connection used for WANs. Write two other alternative types of connections (switching) for WANs.

The most secure but expensive type of connection used for WANs is typically a **leased line** or **dedicated line** connection.

1. **Leased Line / Dedicated Line:**
    - **Security:** Leased lines are highly secure because they provide a dedicated, point-to-point connection between two locations. Data is not shared with other users or over a public network.
    - **Expensive:** Leased lines are expensive because you pay for a fixed bandwidth connection regardless of whether you use it constantly or not.
    - **Reliable:** They offer high reliability and consistent performance.

Two other alternative types of connections (switching) for WANs are:

1. **Virtual Private Network (VPN):**
    
    - **Security:** VPNs provide a secure and cost-effective alternative. They use encryption and tunneling protocols to create secure connections over public networks like the internet.
    - **Cost:** VPNs are generally more cost-effective compared to leased lines because they utilize existing infrastructure.
    - **Versatility:** VPNs are versatile and can be used for remote access, site-to-site connections, and connecting branch offices securely.
      
2. **MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching):**
    
    - **Security:** MPLS is a secure WAN technology that uses label switching to route data between locations. It offers a high level of security and privacy.
    - **Cost:** MPLS can be expensive but is often more cost-effective than leased lines, especially for large networks.
    - **Quality of Service (QoS):** MPLS allows for the prioritization of different types of traffic, making it suitable for applications with specific QoS requirements.

# Question 4

> [!question]
> Sketch how block chaining is used in non-contiguous space allocation for a file on a disk. Consider three blocks of data only.

Non-contiguous allocation, also known as dynamic or linked allocation, is a memory allocation technique used in operating systems to allocate memory to processes that do not require a contiguous block of memory.
