> Explain the terms circuit switching and packet switching with examples

1. Circuit Switching: Circuit switching is an older communication method that establishes a <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">dedicated communication path between two devices for the duration of the conversation. </mark>
    
    Example: Think of a traditional landline phone call as an example of circuit switching. 
    
    Advantages:
    
    - Guaranteed, consistent quality for voice calls.
    - Simple and predictable behavior.
    
    Disadvantages:
    
    - Inefficient use of network resources when there are pauses in conversation.
    - Limited scalability for handling a large number of simultaneous connections.
      
2. Packet Switching: Packet switching is a more modern and flexible method of communication, commonly used in data networks like the internet. 
    
    Example: Imagine sending an email from your computer to a server. The email message is broken into packets, each of which carries a portion of the message along with routing information. 
    
    Advantages:
    
    - Efficient use of network resources as bandwidth is shared among multiple connections.
      
    - Scalable and suitable for handling a large number of connections simultaneously.
    
    Disadvantages:
    
    - Packet switching may introduce some delay or jitter in real-time applications like voice and video calls.
      
    - There's no guaranteed quality of service; network congestion can lead to packet loss or delays.

> Compare the two addressing schemes IPv4 and IPv6

1. **Address Length:**
    
    - **IPv4:** IPv4 addresses are 32-bit long and typically expressed in decimal format, divided into four octets (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
    - **IPv6:** IPv6 addresses are 128-bit long and expressed in hexadecimal format, separated by colons (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).
2. **Address Space:**
    
    - **IPv4:** IPv4 provides around 4.3 billion unique addresses, which was sufficient in the early days of the internet but is now depleted due to the rapid growth of connected devices.
    - **IPv6:** IPv6 was introduced to address the exhaustion of IPv4 addresses. It offers an almost infinite number of unique addresses, approximately 340 undecillion (3.4 x 10^38), ensuring the scalability of the internet.
      
3. **Notation:**
    
    - **IPv4:** Expressed in dotted-decimal notation, with each octet represented by a decimal number (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
    - **IPv6:** Expressed in hexadecimal notation, with colons separating groups of four hexadecimal digits (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).
      
4. **Address Configuration:**
    
    - **IPv4:** Typically, IPv4 addresses are manually configured or assigned dynamically using DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol).
    - **IPv6:** IPv6 supports multiple methods of address assignment, including stateless autoconfiguration and DHCPv6, making it more versatile and efficient for network management.
5. **Address Types:**
    
    - **IPv4:** IPv4 includes three main address types: unicast (one-to-one communication), broadcast (one-to-all within a network segment), and multicast (one-to-many communication to a specific group).
    - **IPv6:** IPv6 simplifies address types, primarily using unicast and multicast, with no concept of broadcast. Multicast is more efficiently handled in IPv6.
6. **Header Complexity:**
    
    - **IPv4:** IPv4 headers are relatively complex and can lead to processing overhead on routers and switches due to the need for features like Network Address Translation (NAT) and checksum calculations.
    - **IPv6:** IPv6 headers are simplified and more efficient, which reduces processing overhead. Features like NAT are less necessary due to the vast address space.
7. **Security and Mobility:**
    
    - **IPv4:** IPv4 lacked built-in security features and efficient support for mobile devices.
    - **IPv6:** IPv6 incorporates improved security through IPsec integration and better support for mobile devices and mobile networks.
8. **Transition Mechanisms:**
    
    - **IPv4:** Transition mechanisms like NAT were introduced to deal with IPv4 address scarcity.
    - **IPv6:** IPv6 was designed as a long-term solution to address the shortcomings of IPv4, and transition mechanisms like dual-stack and tunneling are used to facilitate the migration to IPv6.
