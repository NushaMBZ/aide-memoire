characteristics of properly normalized database
- Scalar values in each fields.
- Absence of redundancy. 
- Minimal use of null values. 
- Minimal loss of information.
## Levels of Normalization

- First Normal Form (1NF) 
- Second Normal Form (2NF) 
- Third Normal Form (3NF) 
- Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) 
- Fourth Normal Form (4NF) 
- Fifth Normal Form (5NF) 
- Domain Key Normal Form (DKNF)

Levels of normalization based on the amount of redundancy in the database.

Most databases should be 3NF or BCNF in order to avoid the database anomalies.
