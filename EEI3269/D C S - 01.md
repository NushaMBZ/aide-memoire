**Things to be considered before an application development**

- What are their problems
- How much time they spend on app
- What is their expectations
- How things are different from web/desktop
- Device fragmentation


**Mobile User Experience (UX) - why of a product**

- Mobile UX design is the design of user experiences for hand-held and wearable devices

-Designers create solutions o meet mobile users unique requirements and restrictions
-Designers focus on accessibility, discoverability and efficiency to optimize on the go interactive experiences 


_Major Components of UX_

- These are best practices and guidelines for designing a mobile user experience (UX) that focuses on optimizing the usability and overall experience for users interacting with mobile applications or websites.

1. Minimize Content - Design for minimal page-loading times (less than three seconds) and cognitive load
2. Simplify Navigation - Most users use one hand; fingertips can be large
3. Restrict User Inputs - Users become frustrated when they must continuously tap buttons. So, design to offer maximum effect for minimum interaction/effort
4. Ensure Continuity and Consistency - Let users continue where they left off and so they can switch easily between mobiles and desktops

By following these guidelines, UX designers can create mobile experiences that are user-friendly, efficient, and tailored to the specific constraints and behaviors associated with mobile usage, ultimately leading to improved user satisfaction and engagement.


**Mobile User Interface (UI) - How of a product**

- A mobile user interface is the graphical and usually touch sensitive display on a mobile device such as a smartphone or tablet that allows the user to interact with the device's apps, features and functions 

- User Interface elements usually fall into one of the following four categories 

1. Input controls
2. Navigation components
3. Informational components
4. Containers


***Stages of UI Design Process***

1. Understand customers and their values
2. Research the competition
3. Sketch out the product
4. Design the product
5. Implement the solution 
6. Evaluate the work and improve it


***Types of Application Requirements***

- **Application requirements refer to the specific criteria and functionalities that a software application must meet in order to fulfill its intended purpose.** These requirements serve as the foundation for the development, design, and testing of the application.

1. Domain Requirements

- The requirements which are characteristic of a particular category or domain of projects

2. Functional Requirements 

-
