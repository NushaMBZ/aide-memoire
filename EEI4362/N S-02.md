# Unified Modeling Language

It is a standardized, general-purpose modeling language used to visualize, design, specify, and document the structure and behavior of software systems. 

> [!tip] 
> UML provides a set of notations and diagrams for modeling various aspects of a software system, making it a powerful tool for communication and analysis during the software development process.

## Groupings of Diagrams

1. **Structural Diagrams**:
    
    - **Class Diagram**: Class diagrams depict the static structure of a system, showing the classes, their attributes, methods, and the relationships between them. 
        
    - **Object Diagram**: Object diagrams represent a snapshot of the objects and their relationships at a specific point in time. 
        
    - **Component Diagram**: Component diagrams focus on the organization and dependencies of the physical components or modules that make up a system.
        
    - **Package Diagram**: Package diagrams help organize the elements of a system into packages, showing how classes and other elements are grouped into larger units for better management and modularity.
        
    - **Composite Structure Diagram**: Composite structure diagrams depict the internal structure of a class, component, or collaboration, showing how its parts are connected and interact.
2. **Behavioral Diagrams**:
    
    - **Use Case Diagram**: Use case diagrams represent the functional requirements of a system from the perspective of its users.
        
    - **Sequence Diagram**: Sequence diagrams illustrate the interactions between objects over time, showing the order of messages and their relationships.
        
    - **Activity Diagram**: Activity diagrams provide a visual representation of the workflow or business processes in a system.
        
    - **State Machine Diagram**: State machine diagrams model the dynamic behavior of an object, showing its states and the transitions between those states.
        
    - **Interaction Overview Diagram**: Interaction overview diagrams combine elements from various interaction diagrams (e.g., sequence diagrams, activity diagrams) to provide a high-level view of interactions and control flow.

## Grouping of Relationships

1. **Structural Relationships**:
    
    - **Association**: A structural relationship that represents a connection or link between classes or objects. 
        
    - **Aggregation**: A form of association that represents a "whole-part" relationship.
        
    - **Composition**: A stronger form of aggregation that signifies a strong ownership relationship between the whole and its parts. 
        
    - **Generalization (Inheritance)**: A structural relationship that defines a superclass-subclass relationship between classes. 
        
    - **Realization**: A structural relationship that represents the implementation of an interface by a class.
        
2. **Behavioral Relationships**:
    
    - **Dependency**: A behavioral relationship that represents a weaker form of association. 
        
    - **Association**: While associations are primarily structural, they can also represent behavioral relationships by indicating that objects of one class interact with objects of another class.
        
    - **Generalization (Inheritance)**: While generalization is primarily a structural relationship, it also has behavioral implications. 
        
    - **Realization**: Realization is a behavioral relationship when it connects a class to an interface.
