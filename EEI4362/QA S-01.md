What are the properties of the BankAccount class? 
- `accountNumber` (String): The account number of the bank account.
- `balance` (double): The balance amount in the account.

What methods are declared in the BankAccount class, and why are they abstract? 
- `abstract void deposit(double amount)`: A method to deposit the given amount into the account.
- `abstract void withdraw(double amount)`: A method to withdraw the given amount from the account.
- `abstract void displayAccountInfo()`: A method to display the account number and balance.
- 
These methods are declared as abstract in the `BankAccount` class because they need to be implemented in the concrete subclass `BankAccountImpl`. Each type of bank account may have its own specific implementation of deposit and withdrawal logic.

How did you simulate exchange rate data in the CurrencyExchangeAPIImpl class? 
In the `CurrencyExchangeAPIImpl` class, the exchange rate data was simulated using a random number generator. The `getExchangeRate` method used `java.util.Random` to generate a random exchange rate between 0.5 and 1.0. This approach was used to simulate exchange rate data since there was no real external API for fetching real-time rates in the given implementation.

What is the main functionality of the getExchangeRate method in the CurrencyExchangeAPI interface? 
The `getExchangeRate` method in the `CurrencyExchangeAPI` interface is responsible for fetching the exchange rate for converting amounts from the `sourceCurrency` to the `targetCurrency`. It takes two String parameters: `sourceCurrency` represents the currency from which the conversion is to be done, and `targetCurrency` represents the currency to which the amount is to be converted. The method returns the exchange rate as a double value.

How does the BankAccountImpl class extend the BankAccount abstract class? 
The `BankAccountImpl` class extends the `BankAccount` abstract class by using the `extends` keyword in its class declaration. It inherits the properties (`accountNumber` and `balance`) and abstract methods (`deposit`, `withdraw`, and `displayAccountInfo`) from the `BankAccount` class. The `BankAccountImpl` class must provide concrete implementations for the abstract methods, making it a complete, usable class.

What additional methods did you implement in the BankAccountImpl class? 
The paper does not mention any specific additional methods implemented in the `BankAccountImpl` class. Additional methods might be implemented in the concrete subclass depending on the specific requirements of different types of bank accounts (e.g., savings, checking). These methods could handle account-specific functionalities, such as interest calculation or overdraft management.

How did you demonstrate the usage of the banking application in the BankingApplication class? 
The paper does not provide detailed code for the `BankingApplication` class, but it mentions that the `main()` method should be present in this class. In the `main()` method, instances of the `BankAccountImpl` and `CurrencyExchangeAPIImpl` classes would be created, and method calls would be made to demonstrate the functionalities of deposit, withdrawal, and currency conversion. Relevant information, such as account details and exchange rates, would be printed to verify the correctness of the implementation.

What are the benefits of using an abstract class in this application? 
Using an abstract class (`BankAccount`) provides a common structure for different types of bank accounts. It allows for code reuse and maintains consistency across the various account types. The abstract class defines common properties and methods, such as `accountNumber`, `balance`, `deposit`, `withdraw`, and `displayAccountInfo`, which can be inherited by concrete subclasses. This simplifies the implementation of individual account types and ensures that essential methods are defined in all account classes.

What are the advantages of using an interface for the currency exchange functionality? 
Using an interface (`CurrencyExchangeAPI`) for the currency exchange functionality allows for loose coupling between the banking application and the specific implementation of the exchange rate fetching mechanism. Different implementations of the `CurrencyExchangeAPI` interface (e.g., real API, simulated data) can be provided without modifying the code of the banking application. This promotes flexibility and makes it easier to switch between different exchange rate data sources.

Could you briefly explain the purpose of the driver class BankingApplication?
The `BankingApplication` class serves as the entry point for the application. It contains the `main()` method, where the application's functionalities are demonstrated and tested. This class creates instances of the concrete classes `BankAccountImpl` and `CurrencyExchangeAPIImpl`, and method calls are made to perform operations like deposit, withdrawal, and currency conversion. The purpose of this class is to showcase the usage of the banking application and verify the correctness of the implementation.
