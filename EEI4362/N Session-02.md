Discuss the advantages of using object-oriented (O-O) techniques in complicated systems that require continuous maintenance, adaptation, and design. Provide examples to support your argument.

- [[QA Day School S-01|Answer]]

Explain the significance of the Unified Modeling Language (UML) as an industry standard for modeling object-oriented systems. Discuss its key features and how it contributes to effective system design and communication within a development team.

- UML provides a standardized notation and set of diagrams that allow software developers, architects, and stakeholders to communicate and understand system designs effectively.
- Features
	- It offers a wide range of diagrams, such as class diagrams, sequence diagrams, activity diagrams, and use case diagrams, each serving a specific purpose in system modeling. 
	- It ensures that developers across different organizations or projects can easily understand and collaborate on system designs. 
	- UML diagrams provide a visual representation of the system, making it easier to communicate complex ideas and concepts.

Explain what is meant by O-O analysis and outline it's goals.

- Object-oriented (OO) analysis is a phase in the software development process that focuses on understanding and defining the requirements and functionalities of a system from an object-oriented perspective.
- Goals : 
	- Understanding System Requirements
	- Identifying Objects and their Characteristics
	- Creating a Conceptual Model
	- Validating the Analysis Model
	- Facilitating Design and Implementation
	- Enhancing System Understanding and Communication
	- Promoting Reusability and Maintainability

Explain the significance of CRC (Class, Responsibilities, and Collaborators) cards in object-oriented analysis and design, and discuss how they are used to represent the responsibilities of classes and the interaction between classes.

- The primary purpose of CRC cards is to document the essential aspects of classes in an object-oriented system. Each card represents a class and contains information about its responsibilities and collaborations with other classes. The responsibilities of a class refer to the tasks or behaviors it is responsible for performing, while collaborators are other classes that interact with the class under consideration.
