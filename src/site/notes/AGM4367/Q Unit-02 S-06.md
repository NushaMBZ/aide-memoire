> [!question]
> What are the factors that determine quantity supplied and quantity demanded for a product?

- Price of the good or service.
- Income of the buyer.
- Price of related goods.
- Consumer Taste
- Government Policies

> [!question]
> What are the factors that shift a market equilibrium? Explain

- Change in demand
	- Income
	- Consumer taste
	- Population
	- Expectation
- Change in supply
	- Technology
	- Input Costs
	- Government Policies
- Changes in External Factors
	- Complementary and Substitute Goods
	- Global Events

> [!question]
> Define the following terms  price elasticity of demand, cross price elasticity of demand and income elasticity of demand.

Price elasticity of demand : Corresponds to the change in quantity demanded as the price of a particular product or service changes.

Cross price elasticity : Measures how the quantity demanded of one good responds to changes in the price of another good.

Income elasticity of demand : Relates to the change in quantity demanded as income of particular individual changes.

> [!question]
> What is meant by elastic, inelastic and unit elastic demand and supply respectively?

Elastic demand is where small changes in price of a particular good lead to a proportionally larger change in quantity demanded.

Inelastic demand is where a change in the price of a good or service results in a relatively smaller change in the quantity demanded.

Unit elastic demand is where change in the price of particular product is equal to change in quantity demanded.

> [!question]
> How does the demand elasticity affect total revenue of a producer when the price increases?

1. Elastic Demand: In this case, when the producer increases the price, the percentage decrease in quantity demanded is greater than the percentage increase in price. As a result, total revenue decreases when the price increases. Producers should be cautious about raising prices when facing elastic demand because they may lose more in total revenue than they gain from the higher price.
    
2. Inelastic Demand: In this case, when the producer increases the price, the percentage decrease in quantity demanded is smaller than the percentage increase in price. As a result, total revenue increases when the price increases. Producers can raise prices in this scenario to increase total revenue because the gain from higher prices outweighs the loss from lower sales volume.
    
3. Unit Elastic Demand: In this case producers can adjust prices without affecting total revenue in this situation.

> [!tip]
> Assume the price elasticity of demand for natural gas is 0.3 in the short run and 0.8 in the long run.

> [!question]
> If the price of a gallon rises from Rs. 800 to 1,200, what happens to the quantity demanded in short run and long run? Use the midpoint method

Midpoint Equation: 

$$
\begin{align}
\%\Delta\text{Price}=\LARGE(\frac{\small(\text{New Price - Old Price})}{{\text{\small(New  Price + Old Price)/2}}})\times 100
\end{align}
$$
therefore : 
Percentage Change in Price = 40%

In short run demand for natural gas is 0.3 which means it's inelastic,
in the event of change in price would less likely to affect the change in quantity demanded. 

For the short run with a price elasticity of 0.3:

Percentage Change in Quantity Demanded (Short Run) = PED (Short Run) * PCB

Percentage Change in Quantity Demanded (Short Run) = 0.3 * 40% = 12%


In long run demand for natural gas is 0.8, which is slightly more elastic than in short run, therefore change in price would affect change in quantity demanded significantly.

For the long run with a price elasticity of 0.8: 

Percentage Change in Quantity Demanded (Long Run) = 0.8 * 40% 

Percentage Change in Quantity Demanded (Long Run) = 32%

In the short run, the quantity demanded is estimated to decrease by approximately 12% in response to the price increase from Rs. 800 to 1,200. In the long run, the quantity demanded is estimated to decrease by approximately 32% in response to the same price increase.

> [!question]
> Can you briefly explain the reasons for having two elasticities for different time periods?

**Short Run Elasticity:** In the short run, consumers and producers have limited ability to adjust to changes in prices. This means that when prices change, the quantity demanded or supplied may not respond significantly. Short-run price elasticity tends to be less elastic (inelastic) because people may not have the time or flexibility to find alternatives or make significant adjustments to their consumption or production.

**Long Run Elasticity:** In the long run, consumers and producers have more time to make adjustments. They can find alternatives, change their habits, or invest in new technologies or resources. As a result, the long-run price elasticity of demand tends to be more elastic because consumers and producers can respond more significantly to price changes.

> [!question]
> Suppose that an increase in price has reduced the total revenue of a seller. What can you say about the demand elasticity of the product?

Since change in price has resulted in significant change in quantity demanded, we can decide that the demand is very elastic.
