# Elasticity of Demand and Supply  

>[!Note]
>Tabular representation of quantity demanded at each price is called the ‘demand  schedule’ and its graphical representation which is usually a downward sloping line  relating price and quantity is called the ‘demand curve’. 

## Market Equilibrium
Market equilibrium refers to the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">state in which the quantity of a particular good or service demanded by buyers is equal to the quantity supplied by producers or sellers</mark> in a given market. 

## Market Forces of Demand  

### Shift/Change in Demand
Change in the quantity of a good or service that consumers are willing and able to buy at every possible price level.

### Demand Shifters
Demand determinants or factors affecting demand, are <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">variables that influence the quantity of a good or service demanded  at different price levels. </mark>

#### Types of Demand Shifters
- Income: <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Changes in consumers' income levels</mark> can affect their purchasing power.
- Price of related goods:
	- Substitute goods: When the <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">price of a substitute good (a product that can replace another) increases, consumers may switch to the cheaper product</mark>, causing an increase in demand for the other product.
	- Complementary goods: When the <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">price of a complementary good (a product often used together with another) increases</mark>, demand for the main product may decrease.
- Tastes and preferences: <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Changes in consumer preferences</mark> can lead to shifts in demand.
- Government policies and regulations: Changes in <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">government policies, such as taxes, subsidies, and regulations, can influence demand.</mark>
- **Population and demographics**: An <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">increase in population can lead to an increase in demand</mark> for certain goods and services, particularly if the new population has a demand for those specific products.

## Market Forces of Supply  

>[!Note]
>The tabular representation of price and quantity supplied is called the supply schedule.  Graphical representation of the relationship between price and the quantity supplied  while other influencing factors are kept constant is called the supply curve. 

### Shift in Supply
A change in the quantity of a good or service that producers are willing and able to offer for sale at every possible price level.

### Supply Shifters

Supply determinants or <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">factors affecting supply, are variables that influence the quantity of a good or service that producers</mark> are willing and able to supply at different price levels.

- Input prices: The <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">cost of production inputs</mark>, such as labor, raw materials, and energy, can significantly impact the supply of goods.
- Technological advancements: <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Improvements in technology can lead to more efficient production methods, reducing the cost of production</mark> and increasing supply. 
- Number of suppliers: An <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">increase in the number of producers or suppliers</mark> in a market can lead to an increase in supply.
- Government regulations: <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Regulations and policies can affect the supply</mark> of goods.
- Natural factors: Natural factors such as weather conditions and natural disasters can impact the supply of goods, particularly in industries like agriculture.

### Shift in both Demand and Supply
When both the demand and supply curves shift simultaneously, the equilibrium price and quantity in a market can change in complex ways.

## Measuring the Magnitude of Change

### Elasticity
This is a quantitative tool which measures <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">‘how much’ the response of buyers and sellers for a change is.</mark> Elasticity values provide us both the direction and the magnitude of a change.

> [!note]
>  Elasticity is defined as the percentage change in quantity supplied or percentage change in quantity demanded in response to a percentage change in one of its determinants.

### Elasticity of Demand

The responsiveness of quantity demanded for a change in its determinants can be defined as the elasticity of demand when measured in percentage terms.

#### Price elasticity of demand
The response of quantity demanded for a change in price of the good is measured by the price elasticity of demand.

$$
\text{Price elasticity of demand}=\frac{\% \Delta QD}{\%\Delta P}
$$
#### Availability of Substitutes
Goods having close substitutes have a more elastic demand.

#### Necessities versus Luxuries
Unlike essential goods, luxury goods tend to have high elasticity.

#### Definition of market
A narrowly defined market has substitutes while a broadly defined market does not.

#### Time Horizon
Some goods tend to have more elastic demand over a longer time period. It provides them adequate chance to get adjusted for close substitutes and to cut down the consumption

The elasticities can be different along a demand curve. To get a consistent value for comparison, mid-point elasticity is calculated:

$$
\text{mid - point price elasticity of demand}=(\frac{(Q_2-Q_1)/(\frac{Q_2+Q_1}{2})}{(P_2-P_1)/(\frac{P_2+P_1}{2})})
$$
$$
\text{Percentage Change = }((\text{New Value - Old Value}) / ((\text{New Value + Old Value}) / 2)) * 100%
$$
#### Different types of demand curves
Demand curves are categorised according to their elasticities. When the elasticity is greater than 1, the demand is elastic, when it is less than 1, the demand is inelastic.

#### Total revenue and demand curves

A change in price and quantity or the displacement of the initial equilibrium brings her different level of revenue. The <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">difference between the initial revenue and the new revenue</mark> shows the revenue change due to a change in the market.

#### Income Elasticity of Demand
The income elasticity of demand measurers the responsiveness of demand for a change in consumers’ income.

$$
IED=\frac{\Delta QD\%}{\Delta I\%}
$$


#### The Cross-Price Elasticity of Demand

$$
CPED=\frac{\Delta QD \% \text{ Good 1}}{\Delta P\% \text{ Good 2}}
$$
### The Elasticity of Supply
The responsiveness of the quantity supplied by the sellers is measured by the elasticity of supply.

#### Price Elasticity of Supply
Price elasticity of supply measures how much the quantity of supply responds to a change in the price of that good.

$$
\text{PES} = \frac{\Delta QS \%}{\Delta P %}
$$
#### Different types of supply curves
Shape of the supply curve is determined by the responsiveness of the quantity supplied to a change in the price.
