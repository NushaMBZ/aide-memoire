> What is a perfectly competitive market? Give some examples for a perfectly competitive market

In a perfectly competitive market, there are <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">many buyers and sellers</mark> of a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">homogeneous (identical) product</mark>, and <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">no single firm has the power to influence the market price.</mark> Additionally, there is <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">free entry and exit of firms in the industry</mark>, perfect information is available to all participants, and transactions are costless.

Examples of perfectly competitive markets are:

1. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Agricultural Markets</mark>: In some agricultural markets, such as the market for wheat or corn, there are many small farmers producing nearly identical products. Prices are often determined by supply and demand forces, and individual farmers have little control over the market price.
    
2. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Stock Market</mark>: The stock market for widely traded stocks can be considered relatively close to a perfectly competitive market. There are many buyers and sellers of the same stocks, and prices are determined by supply and demand.
    
3. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Street Food Vendors</mark>: In some urban areas, street food vendors selling similar products (e.g., hot dogs, pretzels) may operate in conditions close to perfect competition. Prices are often set by market forces, and barriers to entry are relatively low.

> Define the terms TR, MR, AR and MC

1. **Total Revenue (TR):** Total Revenue is the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">total amount of money a firm receives from selling its products</mark> in a given time period. It is calculated by multiplying the quantity of goods sold by the price at which they are sold:
    
    TR = Quantity Sold × Price per Unit
    
2. **Marginal Revenue (MR):** Marginal Revenue is the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">additional revenue a firm earns by selling one more unit of a product.</mark> It represents the change in total revenue when the quantity sold increases by one unit:
    MR = ΔTR / ΔQuantity Sold

```
Quantity :

Yesterday = 10
Today = 15

Total Revenue : 

Yesterday = 1000
Today = 1500

Total Cost:
Yesterday = 800
Today=1000

ΔTR = 500
ΔQTY = 5
```

In a perfectly competitive market, where each additional unit sold has no impact on the market price, <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">MR is equal to the market price.</mark>

3. **Average Revenue (AR):** Average Revenue, also known as the Price, is the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">revenue a firm earns per unit of output</mark>. It is calculated by dividing the total revenue (TR) by the quantity sold (Q):
    
    AR = TR / Quantity Sold
    
    In a perfectly competitive market, <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">AR is equal to the market price</mark>, as all units are sold at the same price.
    
4. **Marginal Cost (MC):** Marginal Cost is the additional cost incurred by a firm when producing one more unit of a product. It represents the change in total cost when the quantity produced increases by one unit:
    
    MC = ΔTotal Cost / ΔQuantity Produced
    
    Marginal Cost is an essential concept for firms in determining their profit-maximizing level of production. In general, a profit-maximizing firm will produce at a level where MR equals MC.




> [!question]
> What is the supply curve of a firm in a perfectly competitive market?


The supply curve of an individual firm is typically a portion of its marginal cost (MC) curve that lies above the average variable cost (AVC) curve.

> [!question]
> . What is a sunk cost in short run?

In the short run, a sunk cost is a cost that has <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">already been incurred and cannot be recovered or changed</mark> by any decision made in the current period.




> [!question]
> What is the objective of a rational firm?

Profit maximization is considered a fundamental goal for many firms, especially in competitive markets. Profit is defined as the difference between total revenue and total cost. In mathematical terms:

Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost

Here's a breakdown of this objective:

1. **Maximizing Profit:** Rational firms aim to make decisions that lead to the highest possible level of profit. Profit maximization is often seen as a rational goal because it allows a firm to allocate its resources efficiently and ensure its long-term survival and growth.
    
2. **Balancing Costs and Revenue:** To maximize profit, a firm needs to balance its costs and revenue. This involves minimizing costs, such as production costs and operating expenses, while maximizing revenue through pricing, sales, and marketing strategies.
    
3. **Short-Run vs. Long-Run Profit:** Firms may also consider both short-term and long-term profit. In the short run, they may make decisions to maximize immediate profitability, while in the long run, they may make investments and strategic choices that lead to sustained profit growth.
    
4. **Risk and Uncertainty:** Firms must also consider risk and uncertainty when pursuing profit maximization. Sometimes, taking on more risk may offer the potential for higher profits, but it also increases the chance of losses. Rational firms weigh these factors in their decision-making.




> [!question]
> Explain the profit maximisation of a firm in short run and long run.

Profit maximization for a firm can be analyzed in both the short run and the long run, and the approaches and considerations can differ between these two time frames:

**Profit Maximization in the Short Run:**

In the short run, a firm's profit-maximizing objective is to earn the highest possible profit within the constraints of its existing resources and capacity. Here's how profit maximization is approached in the short run:

1. **Fixed and Variable Costs:** A firm has fixed costs (costs that do not change with the level of production, like rent) and variable costs (costs that vary with the level of production, like labor and raw materials).
    
2. **Revenue and Marginal Cost:** The firm considers its total revenue (TR) and marginal cost (MC). Total revenue is the income generated from selling its products, while marginal cost is the additional cost incurred to produce one more unit.
    
3. **Profit Calculation:** The firm calculates its total profit, which is the difference between total revenue (TR) and total cost (TC):
    
    Profit (π) = TR - TC
    
4. <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Profit Maximization Point</mark>: <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">To maximize profit </mark>in the short run, the firm will produce the quantity of output where <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">marginal cost (MC) equals marginal revenue (MR).</mark> In a perfectly competitive market, this is where MC = market price (P).
    
5. <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Shutdown Point</mark>: If the market price <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">falls below the firm's average variable cost</mark> (AVC), the firm may choose to shut down temporarily, as it cannot cover its variable costs, and continuing production would lead to greater losses.
    
6. <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Economic Profit or Loss</mark>: The firm may earn economic profit (positive profit) or incur an economic loss (negative profit) <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">depending on whether the market price is above or below the firm's average total cost</mark> (ATC) at the profit-maximizing quantity.

**Profit Maximization in the Long Run:**

In the long run, a firm's objective is to achieve profit maximization over an extended period, considering adjustments in its production capacity and resource allocation. Here's how profit maximization is approached in the long run:

1. <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Adjustable Inputs</mark>: In the long run, <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">all inputs are considered variable</mark>. Firms can adjust their production capacity, expand or reduce the scale of operations, and make changes to fixed inputs like plant size and equipment.
    
2. <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Entry and Exit</mark>: Firms can enter or exit the market in response to profitability. If existing firms are earning positive economic profits, new firms may enter the market, increasing competition and potentially reducing profits. Conversely, if firms are experiencing losses, some may exit the market.
    
3. <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Zero Economic Profit in the Long Run</mark>: In a perfectly competitive market, in the long run, firms will <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">adjust their production and scale of operations </mark>until they earn zero economic profit. This means that they cover all their costs, including an appropriate return on capital, but do not make above-normal profits.
    
4. <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Productive Efficiency</mark>: In the long run, firms aim to achieve productive efficiency, where they produce at the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">lowest possible average total cost</mark> (ATC) given their technology and inputs.
    
5. <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Allocative Efficiency</mark>: Firms in perfectly competitive markets also achieve allocative efficiency in the long run. This means that the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">quantity produced is at a level where the market price (P) equals the marginal cost (MC)</mark>, resulting in the most efficient allocation of resources.




> [!question]
> What is meant by zero economic profit of firms at the long run equilibrium

Zero economic profit, in the context of firms at the long-run equilibrium in economics, refers to a situation where a <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">firm's total revenue (TR) equals its total cost (TC),</mark> including all explicit and implicit costs.




> [!question]
> Why do firms enter and exit the markets?

**Entering a Market:**

1. **Profit Opportunities:** Firms may enter a market when they perceive opportunities to earn economic profits. 
    
2. **Market Expansion:** Firms seek to expand their market presence and reach new customers. Entering new markets, whether geographic or demographic, allows firms to tap into additional revenue streams.
    
3. **Diversification:** Firms may enter new markets as part of a diversification strategy to reduce risk. 
    
4. **Strategic Expansion:** Firms may enter a market to gain strategic advantages, such as gaining access to complementary products, technologies, or distribution channels. Strategic expansion can enhance a firm's competitiveness.
    
5. **Government Incentives:** In some cases, governments may offer incentives to encourage firms to enter specific markets. 
    

**Exiting a Market:**

1. **Low Profitability:** Firms exit markets when they are unable to earn a sufficient level of profit.
    
2. **Declining Relevance:** If a firm's products or services become outdated or less relevant to consumers, it may choose to exit the market rather than invest in updating its offerings.
    
3. **High Costs:** Rising operating costs, such as labor, materials, or regulatory compliance, can make it financially unsustainable for a firm to continue operations in a particular market.
    
4. **Changing Market Conditions:** Changes in market conditions, consumer preferences, or technological advancements can render a market unattractive or unsuitable for a firm's products or services.
    
5. **Strategic Repositioning:** Firms may exit markets as part of a strategic repositioning effort.
    
6. **Mergers and Acquisitions:** In some cases, firms exit markets as a result of mergers, acquisitions, or divestitures. 
    
7. Regulatory or Legal Issues: Regulatory changes, legal challenges, or compliance issues can force firms to exit markets where they can no longer operate profitably or legally.
    
8. **Natural Disasters or External Shocks:** Unexpected events like natural disasters or economic crises can disrupt business operations and lead to market exits.




> [!question]
> A firm in a competitive market receives Rs. 500,000 as the total revenue. Marginal revenue is RS.1000. What is the market price of a unit output? 

1. **Market Price (P) of a Unit Output:**
    
    - In a perfectly competitive market, the market price (P) is equal to the marginal revenue (MR). This is because firms in perfectly competitive markets are price takers, and they can sell additional units at the market price without affecting it.
    
    Given that the marginal revenue (MR) is Rs. 1000, the market price (P) is also Rs. 1000.
    
2. **Amount of Output Sold (Q):**
    
    - To find the amount of output sold (Q), we can use the formula for total revenue (TR), which is equal to the product of the market price (P) and the quantity sold (Q):
    
    TR = P * Q
    
    We are given that the total revenue (TR) is Rs. 500,000, and we've just found that the market price (P) is Rs. 1000. Now, we can rearrange the formula to find Q:
    
    Q = TR / P Q = Rs. 500,000 / Rs. 1000 Q = 500 units
    
    So, the firm sold 500 units of output.
