## Oligopoly
Oligopoly is a market structure in which a few large firms control the market. Oligopolies are characterized by a high degree of market concentration, meaning that a small number of firms account for a large share of the market.

Oligopolies can arise in a number of ways, including:

- **Natural monopoly:** A natural monopoly occurs when the most efficient way to produce a good or service is for a single firm to produce it. For example, the cost of laying down a new railway track is very high, so it is more efficient for a single firm to operate all of the railways in a country.
- **Economies of scale:** Economies of scale occur when the cost of producing a good or service decreases as the quantity produced increases. This means that large firms can produce goods or services at a lower cost than small firms.
- **Entry barriers:** Entry barriers are factors that make it difficult for new firms to enter a market. Entry barriers can include high start-up costs, government regulations, or brand loyalty.

> A **duopoly** is a market structure in which there are only two independent firms that compete with each other.

> **Collusion** is an agreement between two or more firms to act together in order to restrict competition. Collusion can take many forms, including price fixing, market sharing, and output restriction.

> **Cartels** are a type of collusion in which firms agree to fix prices and output. Cartels are illegal in most countries, but they can be difficult to detect and enforce.

## The Equilibrium for an Oligopoly
The equilibrium for an oligopoly is a situation in which the firms in the market have no incentive to change their prices or output. This is because each firm is taking into account the reactions of the other firms in the market.

The equilibrium for an oligopoly can also be found using the Nash equilibrium concept. The Nash equilibrium is a situation in which each firm is doing the best it can, given the actions of the other firms.

The Nash equilibrium for an oligopoly may not be unique. This means that there may be more than one set of prices and outputs that are consistent with the Nash equilibrium.

The equilibrium for an oligopoly can be affected by a number of factors, including:

- The number of firms in the market: The more firms in the market, the more competitive the market will be. This will lead to lower prices and more output.
- The cost structure of the firms: The lower the cost structure of the firms, the more output they will produce and the lower the prices they will charge.
- The demand for the product: The higher the demand for the product, the higher the prices that the firms can charge.
- The government regulation: Government regulation can affect the equilibrium for an oligopoly by setting price controls or by restricting the number of firms that can enter the market.

## How the Size of an Oligopoly Affects the Market Outcome

The size of an oligopoly affects the market outcome in a number of ways.

- **Increased competition:** As the number of firms in an oligopoly increases, the competition between the firms also increases. This can lead to lower prices and more output.
- **Difficult collusion:** It becomes more difficult for firms to collude as the number of firms in an oligopoly increases. This is because it is more difficult for the firms to agree on a price and output level that will benefit all of the firms.
- **Price wars:** When the number of firms in an oligopoly is large, the firms may engage in price wars. This is when the firms compete by lowering their prices in order to attract customers. Price wars can lead to lower prices for consumers, but they can also lead to losses for the firms.
- **Market instability:** The market outcome in an oligopoly can be unstable, especially when the number of firms is large. This is because the firms are constantly trying to outmaneuver each other. This can lead to sudden changes in prices and output, which can be harmful to consumers.

## Economics of Cooperation  
In an oligopoly market, it is beneficial for the firms to cooperate in order to maximise the  profits. However, firms do not cooperate due to difficulties in establishing and  maintaining an agreement among them. Game theory explains the economics of  cooperation using the prisoners’ dilemma.

### The prisoner's dilemma
  
The prisoner's dilemma is a game theory thought experiment that illustrates the difficulty of cooperation. In the prisoner's dilemma, two prisoners are interrogated separately. Each prisoner has two options: confess or not confess. If both prisoners confess, they will both be sentenced to a year in prison. If neither prisoner confesses, they will both be sentenced to six months in prison. However, if one prisoner confesses and the other does not, the prisoner who confesses will be released, while the other prisoner will be sentenced to five years in prison.

The prisoner's dilemma shows that cooperation can be difficult, even when it is in the best interests of both parties. In the prisoner's dilemma, both prisoners would be better off if they both remained silent. However, if one prisoner confesses, the other prisoner is worse off if they do not confess. This creates a conflict between individual incentives and collective benefits.

The prisoner's dilemma has been used to explain a variety of real-world phenomena, such as arms races, trade wars, and the spread of nuclear weapons. It has also been used to design strategies for cooperation, such as the tit-for-tat strategy.

The tit-for-tat strategy is a strategy in which a player cooperates on the first move, and then copies the other player's move on the next move. The tit-for-tat strategy is a successful strategy in the prisoner's dilemma because it encourages cooperation. If one player defects, the other player will defect on the next move. This discourages the first player from defecting in the future.


## Welfare of Soceity
- **Cooperation can benefit firms by allowing them to earn monopoly profits.** When firms cooperate, they can reduce competition and charge higher prices. This can benefit the firms, but it can harm consumers.
- **Lack of cooperation can benefit consumers by leading to low prices.** When firms do not cooperate, they are more likely to compete with each other. This can lead to lower prices for consumers.
- **A perfectly competitive market is considered to be the efficient market structure that will produce the socially efficient level of output.** In a perfectly competitive market, firms have no market power and they produce the quantity of output that minimizes costs and maximizes profits. This is the socially efficient level of output because it maximizes the total surplus.
- **In the absence of cooperation, the output level increases closer to the perfect competition.** This is because firms are more likely to compete with each other when they do not cooperate. This can lead to lower prices and more output, which is beneficial for consumers.
- **However, in some circumstances, lack of cooperation results in negative benefits to a society.** For example, the arms race of the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War increased the risk of nuclear war for both countries. This is an example of how lack of cooperation can lead to negative externalities.
- **When common resources are utilized, the individual firms do not consider the efficient use of common resources and focus on individual profits.** This can lead to the depletion of common resources, such as fisheries or forests. This is an example of how lack of cooperation can lead to the tragedy of the commons.

## Public Policy towards Oligopolies  

Public policy towards oligopolies is often aimed at promoting competition and preventing collusion.

- **Competition law:** Competition law is a set of laws that are designed to protect competition in the market. Competition law typically prohibits practices that are likely to reduce competition, such as price-fixing, market sharing, and bid rigging.
- **Antitrust law:** Antitrust law is a set of laws that are designed to break up monopolies and prevent companies from engaging in anti-competitive practices. Antitrust law is often used to address collusion in oligopolistic markets.

In addition to competition law and antitrust law, governments may also use other policies to promote competition in oligopolistic markets. These policies may include:

- **Regulation:** Governments may regulate the prices or output of oligopolistic firms. This can be done to prevent firms from charging excessive prices or to ensure that they produce a sufficient quantity of output.
- **Public ownership:** Governments may own and operate oligopolistic firms themselves. This can help to ensure that the firms are operated in the public interest.
- **Incentives:** Governments may provide incentives to firms to compete with each other. This can be done by providing subsidies to new firms or by making it easier for firms to enter the market.

The specific policies that are used to promote competition in oligopolistic markets will vary depending on the specific circumstances. However, the goal of these policies is to ensure that oligopolistic markets are competitive and that consumers benefit from lower prices and more choice.

It is important to note that not all oligopolies are harmful to consumers. In some cases, oligopolies can be efficient and can provide consumers with good products and services at a reasonable price. However, when oligopolies collude and reduce competition, they can harm consumers by charging higher prices and reducing output.

## Monopolistic Competition  

Monopolistic competition is a market structure that has some of the features of both perfect competition and monopoly. In a monopolistically competitive market, there are many firms, but each firm produces a differentiated product. This means that the products of the different firms are not perfect substitutes for each other.

As a result of product differentiation, each firm has some market power. This means that the firm can charge a price above marginal cost without losing all of its customers. However, the market power of each firm is limited by the availability of substitutes.

In a monopolistically competitive market, firms compete on price, product quality, and advertising. Firms may also engage in non-price competition, such as offering discounts or loyalty programs.

The outcome of a monopolistically competitive market is typically inefficient. Firms produce less output and charge higher prices than they would in a perfectly competitive market. However, the inefficiency of monopolistic competition is often less than the inefficiency of a monopoly.

Here are some of the key characteristics of monopolistic competition:

- **Many firms:** There are many firms in a monopolistically competitive market. This is in contrast to a monopoly, which has only one firm.
- **Differentiated products:** The products of the firms in a monopolistically competitive market are differentiated. This means that the products are not perfect substitutes for each other.
- **Some market power:** Each firm in a monopolistically competitive market has some market power. This means that the firm can charge a price above marginal cost without losing all of its customers.
- **Competition on price, product quality, and advertising:** Firms in a monopolistically competitive market compete on price, product quality, and advertising.
- **Inefficient outcome:** The outcome of a monopolistically competitive market is typically inefficient. Firms produce less output and charge higher prices than they would in a perfectly competitive market.

## Short Run Equilibrium of a Monopolistic Firm
In the short run, a monopolistically competitive firm behaves in the same way as a monopoly firm. This is because both firms face a downward-sloping demand curve and have some control over the price they charge.

The monopolistically competitive firm will maximize its profit by producing the output level at which marginal revenue equals marginal cost. The price of the product will be determined by the demand curve at this output level.

The following figure shows the short-run equilibrium of a monopolistically competitive firm. The demand curve is downward sloping, and the marginal revenue curve lies below the demand curve. The marginal cost curve intersects the marginal revenue curve at point E, which is the firm's profit-maximizing output level. The price of the product is determined by the demand curve at output level Q.

The monopolistically competitive firm may earn profits, losses, or normal profits in the short run. If the price exceeds the average total cost at the profit-maximizing output level, the firm will earn profits. If the price is below the average total cost, the firm will incur losses. And if the price is equal to the average total cost, the firm will earn normal profits.

## Long Run Equilibrium of a Monopolistic Firm
Profits in the short run does not last for longer. It is an incentive for new firms to enter  and it shifts the demand curves inward. This inward shift reduces the profits of firms who  are already in the market. Firms exit when they lose.
![Pasted image 20230822145829.png](/img/user/assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230822145829.png)



This is because new firms will enter the market if existing firms are earning profits. This will drive down the price and increase the output of the market, until profits are eliminated.

## Monopolistic versus Perfect Competition
Monopolistically competitive markets differ from perfectly competitive markets in a number of ways, including:

- **Excess capacity:** Monopolistically competitive firms produce less output than perfectly competitive firms, even in the long run. This is because monopolistically competitive firms have some market power, which allows them to charge a price above marginal cost. This higher price leads to lower output.
- **Mark-up over marginal cost:** Monopolistically competitive firms charge a mark-up over marginal cost. This means that the price is always greater than marginal cost. The mark-up is the difference between price and marginal cost.
- **Product differentiation:** Monopolistically competitive firms offer differentiated products, meaning that each firm's product is slightly different from the products of other firms in the market. This product differentiation allows monopolistically competitive firms to charge a price above marginal cost.
- **Free entry and exit:** New firms are free to enter and exit monopolistically competitive markets. This is because there are no barriers to entry, such as patents or licenses. The free entry and exit of firms ensures that monopolistically competitive firms earn zero economic profits in the long run.

## Monopolistic Competition and the Welfare of Society  
Monopolistic competition has both positive and negative effects on the welfare of society.

**Positive effects:**

- **Product variety:** Monopolistically competitive firms offer a variety of products, which gives consumers more choice. This can lead to higher consumer satisfaction.
- **Innovation:** Monopolistically competitive firms have an incentive to innovate in order to differentiate their products from those of their competitors. This can lead to new and improved products and services for consumers.
- **Free entry and exit:** The free entry and exit of firms in monopolistically competitive markets ensures that firms are efficient and responsive to consumer demand.

**Negative effects:**

- **Excess capacity:** Monopolistically competitive firms produce less output than perfectly competitive firms, even in the long run. This is because monopolistically competitive firms have some market power, which allows them to charge a price above marginal cost. This higher price leads to lower output.
- **Mark-up over marginal cost:** Monopolistically competitive firms charge a mark-up over marginal cost. This means that the price is always greater than marginal cost. The mark-up is the difference between price and marginal cost. This can lead to higher prices for consumers.
- **Inefficient allocation of resources:** Monopolistically competitive markets are inefficient because they do not produce the socially optimal level of output. This is because monopolistically competitive firms produce less output than perfectly competitive firms.

## Advertising
Advertising is a common strategy used by firms in monopolistically competitive markets. This is because these firms produce differentiated products, so they need to find ways to distinguish their products from those of their competitors. Advertising can help firms to do this by creating brand awareness and conveying information about the benefits of their products.

There are both pros and cons to advertising in monopolistically competitive markets. On the one hand, advertising can help to increase competition and improve the quality of products. This is because advertising can help consumers to make more informed decisions about which products to buy. Additionally, advertising can encourage firms to innovate and develop new products.

Here are some of the arguments for and against advertising in monopolistically competitive markets:

**Arguments for advertising:**

- Advertising can help consumers to make more informed decisions about which products to buy.
- Advertising can encourage firms to innovate and develop new products.
- Advertising can create brand awareness and loyalty, which can help firms to compete more effectively.
- Advertising can help to reduce market power, as it can make it more difficult for firms to charge high prices.

**Arguments against advertising:**

- Advertising can be misleading or deceptive.
- Advertising can create a false sense of need for products, which can lead to consumers spending more money than they need to.
- Advertising can be wasteful, as it often involves creating and distributing messages that are not seen or heard by anyone.
- Advertising can lead to market concentration, as it can help large firms to outspend smaller firms and gain an advantage in the market.

## Branding
Branding is similar to advertising in that it can be used to create brand awareness and loyalty. However, branding is a broader term that encompasses a variety of activities, such as developing a unique brand identity, creating a strong brand image, and managing the brand's reputation.

There are both pros and cons to branding. On the one hand, branding can help businesses to achieve a number of benefits, such as:

- **Increased brand awareness:** Branding can help businesses to make their products and services more visible to consumers. This can lead to increased sales and market share.
- **Brand loyalty:** Branding can help businesses to build customer loyalty. This means that customers are more likely to continue buying the business's products and services, even if there are other, lower-priced options available.
- **Premium pricing:** Branding can help businesses to command a premium price for their products and services. This is because consumers are often willing to pay more for products and services from well-known brands.

On the other hand, branding can also have some drawbacks, such as:

- **High costs:** Branding can be expensive to create and maintain. This is because it requires time, effort, and resources.
- **Risk of brand failure:** There is always a risk that a branding campaign will fail. This can happen if the campaign is not well-designed or if it is not executed effectively.
- **Brand dilution:** Over time, a brand can become diluted if it is not properly managed. This means that the brand may lose its distinctiveness and become less valuable.
