![Pasted image 20230822111322.png](/img/user/assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230822111322.png)
## Oligopoly
Oligopoly is a market structure in which <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">a few large firms control the market.</mark> Oligopolies are characterized by a high degree of market concentration, meaning that a small number of firms account for a large share of the market.

Oligopolies can arise in a number of ways, including:

- **Natural monopoly:** A natural monopoly occurs when the most efficient way to produce a good or service is for a single firm to produce it. 

> [!example]
> For example, the cost of laying down a new railway track is very high, so it is more efficient for a single firm to operate all of the railways in a country.

- **Economies of scale:** Economies of scale occur when the<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;"> cost of producing a good or service decreases as the quantity produced increases.</mark>

- **Entry barriers:** Entry barriers are factors that make it <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">difficult for new firms to enter a market.</mark> 

> [!tip]
> A **duopoly** is a market structure in which there are only two independent firms that compete with each other.

> [!definition]
> **Collusion** is an agreement between two or more firms to act together in order to restrict competition. Collusion can take many forms, including price fixing, market sharing, and output restriction.

> [!definition]
> **Cartels** are a type of collusion in which firms agree to fix prices and output. Cartels are illegal in most countries, but they can be difficult to detect and enforce.

## The Equilibrium for an Oligopoly
The equilibrium for an oligopoly is a situation in which the firms in the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">market have no incentive to change their prices or output. </mark>This is because each firm is taking into account the reactions of the other firms in the market.

The equilibrium for an oligopoly can also be found using the Nash equilibrium concept. The Nash equilibrium is a situation in which <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">each firm is doing the best it can, given the actions of the other firms.</mark>

The Nash equilibrium for an oligopoly may not be unique. This means that there may be more than one set of prices and outputs that are consistent with the Nash equilibrium.

The equilibrium for an oligopoly can be affected by a number of factors, including:

- The number of firms in the market: The more firms in the market, the more competitive the market will be.
- The cost structure of the firms: The lower the cost structure of the firms, the more output they will produce and the lower the prices they will charge.
- The demand for the product: The higher the demand for the product, the higher the prices that the firms can charge.
- The government regulation: Government regulation can affect the equilibrium for an oligopoly by setting price controls or by restricting the number of firms that can enter the market.

## How the Size of an Oligopoly Affects the Market Outcome

The size of an oligopoly affects the market outcome in a number of ways.

- **Increased competition:** As the number of firms in an oligopoly increases, the competition between the firms also increases. This can lead to lower prices and more output.
  
- **Difficult collusion:** It becomes more difficult for firms to collude as the number of firms in an oligopoly increases.
  
- **Price wars:** When the number of firms in an oligopoly is large, the firms may engage in price wars. 
  
- **Market instability:** The market outcome in an oligopoly can be unstable, especially when the number of firms is large. This is because the firms are constantly trying to outmaneuver each other. 

## Economics of Cooperation  
In an oligopoly market, it is <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">beneficial for the firms to cooperate in order to maximise the  profits.</mark> However, firms do not cooperate due to difficulties in establishing and  maintaining an agreement among them. Game theory explains the economics of  cooperation using the prisoners’ dilemma.

### The prisoner's dilemma
  
The prisoner's dilemma is a game theory thought experiment that illustrates the difficulty of cooperation. 

> [!tip]
> In the prisoner's dilemma, two prisoners are interrogated separately. Each prisoner has two options: confess or not confess. If both prisoners confess, they will both be sentenced to a year in prison. If neither prisoner confesses, they will both be sentenced to six months in prison. However, if one prisoner confesses and the other does not, the prisoner who confesses will be released, while the other prisoner will be sentenced to five years in prison.

## Welfare of Soceity

- **Cooperation <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">can benefit firms </mark>by allowing them to earn monopoly profits.** When firms cooperate, they can reduce competition and charge higher prices. This can <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">benefit the firms, but it can harm consumers.</mark>
- **<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Lack of cooperation can benefit consumers</mark> by leading to low prices.** When firms do not cooperate, they are more likely to compete with each other. This can lead to lower prices for consumers.
- **When common resources are utilized, the individual firms do not consider the efficient use of common resources and focus on individual profits.** This can lead to the depletion of common resources, such as fisheries or forests. This is an example of how <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">lack of cooperation can lead to the tragedy of the commons.</mark>

## Public Policy towards Oligopolies  

Public policy towards oligopolies is often aimed at promoting competition and preventing collusion.

- **Competition law:** Competition law is a <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">set of laws that are designed to protect competition in the market.</mark> Competition law typically prohibits practices that are likely to reduce competition, such as price-fixing, market sharing, and bid rigging.
- **Antitrust law:** Antitrust law is a set of laws that are designed to <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">break up monopolies and prevent companies from engaging in anti-competitive practices.</mark> 

In addition to competition law and antitrust law, governments may also use other policies to promote competition in oligopolistic markets. These policies may include:

- **Regulation:** Governments may regulate the prices or output of oligopolistic firms. 
- **Public ownership:** Governments may own and operate oligopolistic firms themselves. 
- **Incentives:** Governments may provide incentives to firms to compete with each other. 

# Monopolistic Competition  

Monopolistic competition is a market structure that <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">has some of the features of both perfect competition and monopoly</mark>. In a monopolistically competitive market, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">there are many firms, but each firm produces a differentiated product.</mark> 

As a result of product differentiation, each firm has some market power. This means that the firm <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">can charge a price above marginal cost without losing all of its customers.</mark> However, the market power of each firm is limited by the availability of substitutes.

In a monopolistically competitive market, firms compete on price, product quality, and advertising. .

The outcome of a monopolistically competitive market is typically inefficient. Firms produce <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">less output and charge higher prices than they would in a perfectly competitive market.</mark> 

Here are some of the key characteristics of monopolistic competition:

- **Many firms:** There are many firms in a monopolistically competitive market. 
- **Differentiated products:** The products of the firms in a monopolistically competitive market are differentiated.
- **Some market power:** Each firm in a monopolistically competitive market has some market power. 
- **Competition on price, product quality, and advertising:** Firms in a monopolistically competitive market compete on price, product quality, and advertising.
- **Inefficient outcome:** The outcome of a monopolistically competitive market is typically inefficient.

## Short Run Equilibrium of a Monopolistic Firm

In the short run, a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">monopolistically competitive firm behaves in the same way as a monopoly firm</mark>. This is because both firms<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;"> face a downward-sloping demand curve and have some control over the price they charge.</mark>

The monopolistically competitive firm will <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">maximize its profit by producing the output level at which marginal revenue equals marginal cost.</mark> The price of the product will be determined by the demand curve at this output level.

The following figure shows the short-run equilibrium of a monopolistically competitive firm. 

> [!note]
> The demand curve is downward sloping, and the marginal revenue curve lies below the demand curve. The marginal cost curve intersects the marginal revenue curve at point E, which is the firm's profit-maximizing output level. The price of the product is determined by the demand curve at output level Q.

![Pasted image 20230822124849.png](/img/user/assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230822124849.png)

The monopolistically competitive firm may earn profits, losses, or normal profits in the short run. If <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">the price exceeds the average total cost at the profit-maximizing output level, the firm will earn profits.</mark> If the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">price is below the average total cost, the firm will incur losses.</mark> And if the price is equal to the average total cost, the firm will earn normal profits.

## Long Run Equilibrium of a Monopolistic Firm

Profits in the short run does not last for longer. It is an incentive for new firms to enter  and it shifts the demand curves inward. This inward shift reduces the profits of firms who  are already in the market. Firms exit when they lose.
![Pasted image 20230822145829.png](/img/user/assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230822145829.png)



This is because new firms will enter the market if existing firms are earning profits. This will drive down the price and increase the output of the market, until profits are eliminated.

## Monopolistic versus Perfect Competition
Monopolistically competitive markets differ from perfectly competitive markets in a number of ways, including:

- **Excess capacity:** Monopolistically competitive firms produce less output than perfectly competitive firms, even in the long run. 
- **Mark-up over marginal cost:** Monopolistically competitive firms charge a mark-up over marginal cost. The mark-up is the difference between price and marginal cost.
- **Product differentiation:** Monopolistically competitive firms offer differentiated products, meaning that each firm's product is slightly different from the products of other firms in the market. 
- **Free entry and exit:** New firms are free to enter and exit monopolistically competitive markets. This is because there are no barriers to entry, such as patents or licenses. The free entry and exit of firms ensures that monopolistically competitive firms earn zero economic profits in the long run.

## Monopolistic Competition and the Welfare of Society  

**Positive effects:**

- **Product variety:** Monopolistically competitive firms <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">offer a variety of products, which gives consumers more choice. This can lead to higher consumer satisfaction.</mark>
- **Innovation:** Monopolistically competitive firms have an <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">incentive to innovate in order to differentiate their products</mark> from those of their competitors. This can lead to new and improved products and services for consumers.
- **Free entry and exit:** The free entry and exit of firms in monopolistically competitive markets ensures that firms are efficient and responsive to consumer demand.

**Negative effects:**

- **Excess capacity:** Monopolistically competitive firms <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">produce less output than perfectly competitive firms</mark>, even in the long run. This is because monopolistically competitive firms have some market power, which allows them to charge a price above marginal cost. This higher price leads to lower output.
- **Mark-up over marginal cost:** Monopolistically competitive firms charge a mark-up over marginal cost. 
- **Inefficient allocation of resources:** Monopolistically competitive markets are inefficient because they do not produce the socially optimal level of output. This is because monopolistically competitive firms produce less output than perfectly competitive firms.

## Advertising
Advertising is a common strategy used by firms in monopolistically competitive markets. This is because these firms produce differentiated products, so they <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">need to find ways to distinguish their products from those of their competitors.</mark> 

Here are some of the arguments for and against advertising in monopolistically competitive markets:

**Arguments for advertising:**

- Advertising can help consumers to make more informed decisions about which products to buy.
- Advertising can encourage firms to innovate and develop new products.
- Advertising can create brand awareness and loyalty, which can help firms to compete more effectively.
- Advertising can help to reduce market power, as it can make it more difficult for firms to charge high prices.

**Arguments against advertising:**

- Advertising can be misleading or deceptive.
- Advertising can create a false sense of need for products, which can lead to consumers spending more money than they need to.
- Advertising can be wasteful, as it often involves creating and distributing messages that are not seen or heard by anyone.
- Advertising can lead to market concentration, as it can help large firms to outspend smaller firms and gain an advantage in the market.

## Branding
Branding is similar to advertising in that it can be used to create <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">brand awareness and loyalty.</mark> However, branding is a broader term that encompasses a variety of activities, such as <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">developing a unique brand identity</mark>, creating a strong brand image, and managing the brand's reputation.

There are both pros and cons to branding. On the one hand, branding can help businesses to achieve a number of benefits, such as:

- **Increased brand awareness:** Branding can help businesses to make their products and services more visible to consumers.
- **Brand loyalty:** Branding can help businesses to build customer loyalty. 
- **Premium pricing:** Branding can help businesses to command a premium price for their products and services. 

On the other hand, branding can also have some drawbacks, such as:

- **High costs:** Branding can be expensive to create and maintain. This is because it requires time, effort, and resources.
- **Risk of brand failure:** There is always a risk that a branding campaign will fail. 
- **Brand dilution:** Over time, a brand can become diluted if it is not properly managed.
