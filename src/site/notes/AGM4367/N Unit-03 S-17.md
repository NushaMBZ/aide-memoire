# National Income

> [!definition]
> National income is the total value of all the final goods and services produced in a country during a specific period of time. 

## Gross Domestic Product

> [!Definition]
> It is the total monetary or market value of all the finished goods and services produced within a country's borders in a specific time period.

GDP can be calculated in three ways:

1. **Expenditure approach:** This method sums up the value of all goods and services consumed by households, businesses, and the government, as well as net exports.
2. **Production approach:** This method sums up the value of all goods and services produced by all industries in the economy.
3. **Income approach:** This method sums up all wages, salaries, profits, and other forms of income earned by individuals and businesses in the economy.

> [!tip]
> Real GDP takes into account the effects of inflation while nominal GDP does not.

### **Real GDP**

> [!definition]
> It is the total market value of all final goods and services produced within a country's borders during a specific period of time, adjusted for inflation.

```
Real GDP = Nominal GDP / Price Index
```

> [!example]
> Suppose a country has a nominal GDP of $1 trillion and a price index of 1.10. This means that the country's real GDP is $909 billion.

### Nominal GDP

> [!definition]
> The total market value of all final goods and services produced within a country's borders during a specific period of time, at current prices.

```
Nominal GDP = Quantity of goods and services produced * Price of goods and services
```

> [!example]
> Suppose a country produces 100 widgets in a year and each widget sells for $10. The country's nominal GDP would be $1,000.


The sum of financial value of consumption (C), gross investment (I), government purchases of goods and services ( G ), and net exports ( X ) produced within a nation during a given year is
considered as GDP and can be stated as follows. 

$$
GDP=C+I+G+X
$$
> [!tip]
> GDP measures the value of final goods and services to avoid double counting.

> [!tip]
> GDP considers the currently produced output of a product or service. It does not take into account the already existing buildings or houses.

> [!tip]
> Goods and services are valued at the market price

### Income Approach

The income approach to measuring gross domestic product (GDP) is based on the accounting principle that <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">all expenditures in an economy should equal the total income generated by the production of all that economy's goods and services.
</mark>


#### Components

- **Compensation of employees:** This includes wages, salaries, bonuses, and other forms of compensation paid to employees.
  
- **Net operating surplus:** This is the income of businesses after all costs of production have been paid, including taxes on production and imports minus subsidies on production.
  
- **Depreciation:** This is the allowance for the wear and tear of capital assets, such as machinery and equipment.
  
- **Net factor income from abroad:** This is the difference between the income earned by residents from foreign investments and the income earned by foreign residents within the country's borders.

### **Expenditure Approach**

The expenditure approach to GDP is based on the idea that <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">all production must be consumed or invested.</mark> It measures GDP by adding up all the spending on final goods and services in an economy over a set period of time.

#### Components

- **Consumption:** This is the spending by households on goods and services.
- **Investment:** This is the spending by businesses on capital goods, such as machinery and equipment, and on inventories.
- **Government spending:** This is the spending by government on goods and services.
- **Net exports:** This is the difference between a country's exports and its imports.

### **Value-added approach**

The value-added approach to GDP <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">measures the contribution of each industry to the overall economy.</mark> It does this by adding up the value added by each industry in the economy. 

> [!tip]
> Value added is the difference between the value of the goods and services produced by an industry and the value of the intermediate goods and services used in the production process.

#### Components

- **Agriculture:** This includes the production of crops and livestock.
- **Mining:** This includes the extraction of minerals and other resources from the ground.
- **Manufacturing:** This includes the production of goods from raw materials.
- **Construction:** This includes the building and maintenance of structures.
- **Trade, transportation, and communications:** This includes the distribution of goods and services, as well as the provision of communication services.
- **Finance, insurance, and real estate:** This includes the provision of financial services, insurance, and real estate transactions.
- **Government services:** This includes the provision of government services, such as education, healthcare, and security.

### Limitations

- **GDP does not measure the quality of goods and services produced.**
	- For example, a country that produces a lot of low-quality goods will have a higher GDP than a country that produces a few high-quality goods.
  
- **GDP does not take into account the distribution of income.** 
	- A country with a high GDP could have a very unequal distribution of income, with a small percentage of the population earning a large majority of the income.
  
- **GDP does not measure the sustainability of economic growth.** 
	- A country could have high GDP growth in the short term by depleting its natural resources or by polluting the environment. 
  
- **GDP does not measure non-market activities.**
	- These include activities such as childcare, volunteer work, and housework. 


## Gross National Product (GNP)

> [!Definition]
> It is an economic measure of the total market value of all final goods and services produced in a specific period of time (usually a year) by a country's residents, both domestically and abroad.

### Formula
```
GNP = GDP + Net factor income from abroad
```

> [!example]
> Suppose a country has a GDP of $1 trillion and net factor income from abroad of $100 billion. The country's GNP would be $1.1 trillion. This means that the country's residents produced $1.1 trillion worth of goods and services in the year, both domestically and abroad.

GNP can be used for a variety of purposes, including:

- Measuring the size and growth of a country's economy.
- Comparing the economies of different countries.
- Assessing the impact of government policies on economic growth.
- Making decisions about foreign investment.

## **Net Domestic Product (NDP)**

> [!definition]
> It is the total market value of all final goods and services produced within a country's borders during a specific period of time, minus the value of depreciation of capital assets.

### Formula
```
NDP = GDP - Depreciation
```

> [!example]
> Suppose a country has a GDP of $1 trillion and depreciation of $100 billion. The country's NDP would be $900 billion. This means that the country's residents produced $900 billion worth of goods and services in the year, after taking into account the wear and tear on capital assets.

NDP can be used for a variety of purposes, including:

- Measuring the size and growth of a country's economy.
- Comparing the economies of different countries.
- Assessing the impact of government policies on economic growth.
- Making decisions about investment.

## Price Indices

> [!definition]
> These used to measure changes in the overall price level of goods and services in an economy.

- **Consumer Price Index (CPI)**: The CPI measures the change in the cost of living for a typical urban household.
	- It is calculated by tracking the prices of a basket of goods and services that are commonly purchased by households.
	  
- **Producer Price Index (PPI)**: The PPI measures the change in the prices that producers receive for their goods and services.
	- It is calculated by tracking the prices of a basket of goods and services that are sold by producers.
	  
- **GDP deflator**: The GDP deflator is a price index that is used to measure the change in the prices of all goods and services produced in an economy.
	- It is calculated by dividing nominal GDP by real GDP.

## **Personal disposable income (DPI)**

> [!definition]
> The amount of money that individuals or households have to spend or save after income taxes have been deducted. It is calculated by subtracting personal income taxes from personal income.

> [!tip]
> It is calculated by subtracting personal income taxes from personal income.
