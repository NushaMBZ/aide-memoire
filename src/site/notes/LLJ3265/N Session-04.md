# Constitutional Law

## Constitution
Body of rules which <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">in effect governs all other rules</mark>, and which <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">determines  the structure, powers and functions of the principal state organs</mark> and which  <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">regulates the relations between these principal state organs and the private citizen</mark>.

> One ring to rule them all

A constitution will deal principally with the three main functions of a state:  
- legislative (making of laws)
- executive (carrying out the laws) 
- judicial  (determining disputes according to the laws).

It will also <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">deal with the different levels of  government</mark> recognized in a country, such as the central government and the lower  levels of administration.

## Classification of Constitution   
Constitutions may be classified as :
- written or unwritten
- flexible or rigid
- Autochthonous and Granted

A Rigid constitution is one under which certain laws generally known as  <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">fundamental laws either cannot be changed in the same manner as ordinary laws or  cannot be changed at all.</mark>  

An Autochthonous Constitution is one which has its <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">legal origin in the country</mark>.

Constitution has a place  higher than that of ordinary statutes and ordinary statutes are expected to be  consistent with the Constitution.

Although the Constitution is also passed by the legislature as other laws, a  <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">constitution is passed in a special way requiring more consensus than an ordinary  law</mark>.

Generally, Courts are <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">authorized to declare as invalid any law inconsistent with the  Constitution</mark>, but in Sri Lanka it is not so. There is <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">provision to declare proposed  statues (Bills) as inconsistent with the Constitution, but once they are passed by the  legislature (Parliament) and become law they cannot be challenged and struck  down.   </mark>
