The application of the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Roman – Dutch Law is not restricted to a territory,  today and is considered as part of the General Law</mark> of Sri Lanka.  The  <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">General Law applies to all persons in Sri Lanka when their own personal  laws do not apply.    
</mark>

In a way it's limited to :

- The law of contract
- Contractual capacity
- Law of property

# English Law
Aftermath of Kandyan agreement, Sri Lanka became a British colony and the English law became applicable to the whole country.

Ever since then, English law was introduced into Sri Lanka in two ways :

- Through legislation
- Through case law or Judicial decisions

<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Laws of England Ordinance</mark> states that laws of England would be the laws of Ceylon as specified.

Also, Some legislative enactments introduced by British were primarily based on the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">English legal principles</mark>, As a result the English legal principles found their way into the Sri Lankan legal system through legislative process. 

In the meantime, the British set up their own courts system in Ceylon, with <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Privy Council in the GB as the apex court</mark> of the country.

The common law, principle of *stare decisis*, required that the decisions of  superior courts, including the Privy Council were applicable to the lower  courts.

Areas of law which had been shaped by the English law are,

- Constitutional Law
- Commercial Law
- Procedural Law
- Testamentary Law
- Criminal Law
- Administrative Law
- Income Tax Law

# Kandyan Law

Kandyan Law enforced in Kandyan territories during the 18th and 19th centuries was not a personal law. Instead, it was a law that originated from the customs of the Sinhalese people but had evolved over time to become the law of the entire country under the authority of the King.

<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">During the rule of the Kandyan Kings</mark> everyone lived in that area was  subject to Kandyan law, which is why it was a territorial law at that time.  <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">After the British acquisition</mark> of the Kandyan provinces, their law became the  general law of the country, and the Kandyan law was made applicable to  those who were “Kandyans” only.

# Tesawalamei Law  

The codified Tesawalamei law was approved by Dutch governor amd was applied in resolving civil disputes from 1707 to 1806. The British, who found this when they acquired the Jaffna peninsula, gave   special recognition to this in regulation No: 18 of 1806. 

The sole criterion that would be adopted in deciding whether a person is  governed by <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Tesawalamai Law or not is whether the particular Tamil person  had acquired an inhabitancy in the Northern Province.</mark>

The courts have  consistently held that the Tesawalamai Law applied <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">not only to Tamil  inhabitants of Jaffna in 1806 and to their descendants but also to any Tamil  who comes and settles down and acquire inhabitancy in Jaffna.</mark> 


# Muslim Law

The application of Muslim Law   entirely <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">depends on whether a person is an  adherent of Islam.</mark>  Any person who embraces Islam at a later stage may be  governed by Muslim Law from the date of his or her conversion to Islam.   

Muslim law which was codified by the Dutch became known as the  Mohammedan Code in 1806.   

It contains two main titles called First title and the Second Title. 
- Sections 1 to 63 of the First Title dealt with Succession,  inheritance and other incidents occasioned by death .  
- Sections 64 to 102 of the Second Title was on matrimonial  affairs and covered this aspect.  

The Muslim community of Sri Lanka was dissatisfied with the Code on the  ground that aspects of it were obsolete and not in harmony with the religious  law and practice of Islam. The <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Mohammedan Code was completely repealed  by the year 1931. </mark> 

Today there are three main statutes applicable to the Muslims;  
- The Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act No: 13 of 1951  
- The Muslim Mosques and Charitable Trusts or Wakfs Act No:   of 1956  
- Muslim Intestate Succession Ordinance No: 10 of 1931
