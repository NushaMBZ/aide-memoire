# Domain

The domain of a function refers to the set of all possible input values or arguments for that function. It specifies the valid values that can be plugged into the function to produce meaningful outputs.

# Numbers

The domain of a function can involve different types of numbers depending on the context and the nature of the function. Here are some commonly encountered types of numbers in the domain:

1.  Natural Numbers ($\mathbb{N}$): These are the counting numbers, including zero. It is denoted as $\mathbb{N} = {0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots}$.
    
2.  Whole Numbers ($\mathbb{W}$): Whole numbers include all the natural numbers along with zero. It is denoted as $\mathbb{W} = {0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots}$.
    
3.  Integers ($\mathbb{Z}$): Integers include all the whole numbers along with their negative counterparts. It is denoted as $\mathbb{Z} = {\ldots, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots}$.
    
4.  Rational Numbers ($\mathbb{Q}$): Rational numbers are numbers that can be expressed as a ratio of two integers, where the denominator is not zero. It is denoted as $\mathbb{Q}$. For example, $\frac{1}{2}$, $-\frac{3}{4}$, and $0.8$ are rational numbers.
    
5.  Irrational Numbers ($\mathbb{I}$): Irrational numbers are numbers that cannot be expressed as a ratio of two integers. They have non-terminating and non-repeating decimal representations. Common examples include $\pi$ and $\sqrt{2}$. The set of irrational numbers is denoted as $\mathbb{I}$.
    
6.  Real Numbers ($\mathbb{R}$): Real numbers include both rational and irrational numbers. They represent all possible points on the number line. It is denoted as $\mathbb{R}$.
    
7.  Complex Numbers ($\mathbb{C}$): Complex numbers are numbers of the form $a + bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers, and $i$ represents the imaginary unit ($i^2 = -1$). The set of complex numbers is denoted as $\mathbb{C}$.



## Data Anomalies
Problems that can arise on the event of poorly planned databases where <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">all data and/or information are stored in one single file.</mark>

Three types of data anomalies
- **Insertion Anomaly**
	- The insertion of a data record is not possible <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">without adding some addtional unrelated data to the record.</mark>
- **Deletion Anomaly**
	- Deletion of a data record results in <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">losing some unrelated information</mark> that was stored as part of the record that gets deleted from the table.
- **Update Anomaly**
	- If <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">updates do not occur at all the places</mark>.

## Functional Dependancy
A relationship between two sets of attributes within a table. It describes h<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">ow the values of one set of attributes determine the values of another set.</mark>

| Emp_Id | Emp_Name | Age |
| ------ | -------- | --- |
| 152    | Ahmed    | 100 |
| 153    | Jhon     | 52  |
| 154    | Ahmed    | 52  |
|        |          |     |

## Transitive Dependancy
A transitive dependency refers to a relationship between three or more attributes within a table. It occurs when the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">value of one attribute determines the value of another attribute indirectly through a chain of functional dependencies.</mark>

$A \rightarrow B$ Functional Dependancy
$B \rightarrow C$ Functional Dependancy
$A \rightarrow C$ Transitive Dependancy

| Emp_Id $(A)$ | Emp_Name | Age | Dep_No $(B)$ | Dep_Name $(C)$  |
| ------ | -------- | --- | ------ | ---------- |
| 152    | Ahmed    | 100 | 1      | Colombo    |
| 153    | Jhon     | 52  | 2      | New Jearsy |
| 154    | Ahmed    | 52  | 1      | Colombo    | 
|        |          |     |        |            |

## Full Dependancy
Determinants have the minimal number of attributes to maintain the functional dependancy with all non-key attributes.

| Order_id | Product_id | Quantity |
| -------- | ---------- | -------- |
| 1        | 4          | 5        |
| 2        | 6          | 9         |

## Partial Dependancy
A concept in database normalization that describes a functional dependency between <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">non-key attributes (attributes that are not part of the primary key) and a part of the primary key.</mark>

StudentID $\rightarrow$ Student_Name
ProjectID $\rightarrow$ Project_Name

| StudentID | ProjectID | Student_Name | Project_Name |
| --------- | --------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| S01       | 199       | Jhon         | Whatever     |
| S02       | 200       | Alisa        | Null             |

## Normalization

Normalization is the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">derivation of data as a set of non-redundant, consistent and interdependent relations.</mark>

### Benefits
- Helps reduce data storage space
- Helps reduce inconsistant data
- Helps reduce <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">update cost</mark>
- Helps identify and remove m2m relationships
- Improves flexibility of the system
- Helps avoid data anomalies
### Normal Forms
A state of a relation that results from <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">applying simple rules regarding functional dependencies to that relation.</mark>

| Type | Normalization                  |
| ---- | ------------------------------ |
| 0NF  | multi-valued attributes exists |
| 1NF  | remove multi-valued attributes |
| 2NF  | remove partial dependancies    |
| 3NF  | remove transitive dependancies |
| BCNF | remove functional depenencies  |
|      |                                |
