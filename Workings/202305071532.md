# Domain

The domain of a function refers to the set of all possible input values or arguments for that function. It specifies the valid values that can be plugged into the function to produce meaningful outputs.

# Numbers

The domain of a function can involve different types of numbers depending on the context and the nature of the function. Here are some commonly encountered types of numbers in the domain:

1.  Natural Numbers ($\mathbb{N}$): These are the counting numbers, including zero. It is denoted as $\mathbb{N} = {0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots}$.
    
2.  Whole Numbers ($\mathbb{W}$): Whole numbers include all the natural numbers along with zero. It is denoted as $\mathbb{W} = {0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots}$.
    
3.  Integers ($\mathbb{Z}$): Integers include all the whole numbers along with their negative counterparts. It is denoted as $\mathbb{Z} = {\ldots, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots}$.
    
4.  Rational Numbers ($\mathbb{Q}$): Rational numbers are numbers that can be expressed as a ratio of two integers, where the denominator is not zero. It is denoted as $\mathbb{Q}$. For example, $\frac{1}{2}$, $-\frac{3}{4}$, and $0.8$ are rational numbers.
    
5.  Irrational Numbers ($\mathbb{I}$): Irrational numbers are numbers that cannot be expressed as a ratio of two integers. They have non-terminating and non-repeating decimal representations. Common examples include $\pi$ and $\sqrt{2}$. The set of irrational numbers is denoted as $\mathbb{I}$.
    
6.  Real Numbers ($\mathbb{R}$): Real numbers include both rational and irrational numbers. They represent all possible points on the number line. It is denoted as $\mathbb{R}$.
    
7.  Complex Numbers ($\mathbb{C}$): Complex numbers are numbers of the form $a + bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers, and $i$ represents the imaginary unit ($i^2 = -1$). The set of complex numbers is denoted as $\mathbb{C}$.
