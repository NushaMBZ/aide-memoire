# Database Normalization

Database normalization is a systematic process in database design that aims to <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity</mark> by organizing data into separate tables and structuring those tables in a way that minimizes duplication of information.


## Anomalies

Irregularities or issues that can occur when data is not organized or structured optimally.

These anomalies can lead to inconsistencies, errors, and inefficiencies in database operations. There are three common types of anomalies:

1. **Insertion Anomalies:** Insertion anomalies occur when you attempt to add new data to a database, and you encounter difficulties because of the database's structure. These anomalies often arise in non-normalized or poorly designed databases. For example:
    
    - Adding a new record may fail if it doesn't include values for all required fields.
    - Adding data for an entity with multiple relationships can lead to duplicating information or entering data that doesn't belong in that entity.
2. **Update Anomalies:** Update anomalies happen when you need to change data within the database and encounter issues due to its structure. Common scenarios include:
    
    - Updating an attribute for one entity might require updating the same information in multiple places, leading to inconsistencies or errors.
    - If you don't update all instances of related data simultaneously, you might end up with inconsistent or contradictory information.
3. **Deletion Anomalies:** Deletion anomalies occur when you attempt to remove data from the database and face difficulties due to its design. In some cases:
    
    - Deleting one record may lead to unintentional loss of related data, which might still be relevant for other records.
    - Deleting a record might not be possible if it's related to other data, which can lead to clutter and inefficiency in the database.

## Levels of Normalization

There are several normal forms, with the most common ones being the first three. Here are the levels of normalization:

1. **First Normal Form (1NF):**
    
    - At this level, the database table is free of repeating groups, meaning that each column contains only atomic, indivisible values.
    - All entries in a column are of the same data type.
    - Each row in the table is uniquely identifiable with a primary key.
2. **Second Normal Form (2NF):**
    
    - To achieve 2NF, the database must already be in 1NF.
    - Additionally, all non-key attributes (attributes that are not part of the primary key) must be functionally dependent on the entire primary key, not just part of it. In other words, all partial dependencies must be removed.
    - This usually involves breaking a table into multiple related tables.
3. **Third Normal Form (3NF):**
    
    - To reach 3NF, the database must already be in 2NF.
    - In addition to meeting 2NF requirements, no non-key attribute should be transitively dependent on the primary key. In simpler terms, if attribute A is functionally dependent on the primary key, and attribute B is functionally dependent on A, then B must be part of the primary key or moved to a separate table.
    - This level of normalization aims to eliminate transitive dependencies.
4. **Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF):**
    
    - BCNF is a stricter form of normalization than 3NF.
    - To achieve BCNF, every non-trivial functional dependency (where one attribute determines another) must involve a superkey (a set of attributes that uniquely identifies a row).
    - BCNF is concerned with more complex situations where an attribute depends on a subset of the superkey but not the whole superkey.
5. **Fourth Normal Form (4NF):**
    
    - 4NF builds upon the previous forms by addressing multi-valued dependencies.
    - It ensures that no independent multi-valued facts are stored in the same table.
6. **Fifth Normal Form (5NF) or Project-Join Normal Form (PJ/NF):**
    
    - 5NF and PJ/NF address certain cases of decomposing data into further tables to eliminate join dependencies.
7. **Domain-Key Normal Form (DKNF):**
    
    - DKNF is the highest level of normalization and is considered as a theoretical ideal.
    - At this level, all constraints are in place to ensure that data integrity is maintained.
    - DKNF addresses issues like join dependencies, multi-valued dependencies, and more complex scenarios.
