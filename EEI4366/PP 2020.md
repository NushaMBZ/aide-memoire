> Explain the following two relational concepts using a sample relation of your own choice providing suitable examples.

1. Entity Integrity : It ensures the uniqueness and consistency of data within a relational database.


| EmployeeID | FirstName | LastName | DepartmentID | Salary |
| ---------- | --------- | -------- | ------------ | ------ |
| 101        | Alice     | Smith    | 1            | 50000  |
| 102        | Bob       | Johnson  | 2            | 60000  |
| 103        | Carol     | Davis    | 1            | 55000  |
| 104        | David     | Wilson   | 3            | 62000  |


|DepartmentID|DepartmentName|
|---|---|
|1|HR|
|2|Finance|
|3|IT|

In our "Employees" relation:

- EmployeeID serves as the primary key, ensuring the uniqueness of each employee's record.
- Entity Integrity ensures that no two employees have the same EmployeeID, preventing duplicate records.

2. Referential Integrity: It ensures the consistency of relationships between tables.

- The "DepartmentID" column in the "Employees" table is a foreign key that references the "DepartmentID" column in the "Departments" table.
  
- Referential Integrity ensures that the values in the "DepartmentID" column of the "Employees" table correspond to valid DepartmentIDs in the "Departments" table.

> Explain what is meant by a transaction and why it is an important unit of operation in a DBMS?

Transaction is a sequence of one or more database operations that are treated as a single, indivisible unit of work. 

Here are some key characteristics of transactions and why they are important in a DBMS:

1. **Atomicity:** Transactions are atomic, meaning that they are treated as a single, all-or-nothing unit of work. Either all the operations within a transaction are completed successfully, or none of them are. 
    
2. **Consistency:** Transactions help maintain the consistency of the database. The database starts in a consistent state, and a transaction should leave it in a consistent state. 
    
3. **Isolation:** Transactions are isolated from each other to prevent interference between concurrent transactions. 
    
4. **Durability:** Once a transaction is successfully committed, its changes to the database are permanent and survive system failures.

> Write single sentence with a suitable example to illustrate the following relational concepts

- Candidate Key : A candidate key is a <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">set of one or more columns in a relational table that can uniquely identify each row</mark>; for example, in a "Students" table, both "StudentID" and "Email" can serve as candidate keys since they can uniquely identify students.
- Primary key: A primary key is a <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">specific candidate key chosen to be the main method of uniquely identifying rows</mark> in a table; for instance, in an "Orders" table, "OrderID" is the primary key, ensuring each order has a unique identifier.
- Composite key: A composite key is a primary key that consists of <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">two or more columns used together to uniquely identify rows;</mark> for instance, in an "Employees" table, a composite key might include both "EmployeeID" and "DepartmentID" to ensure uniqueness.
- Unique key: A unique key is a constraint that <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">enforces the uniqueness of values in one or more columns,</mark> similar to a candidate key, but it is not necessarily the chosen primary key; for example, in a "Books" table, "ISBN" can be a unique key to ensure each book has a unique ISBN.
- Atomic key: An atomic key is a key that consists of a <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">single column with indivisible, non-composite values</mark>, such as a "SocialSecurityNumber" in a "Citizens" table, ensuring each citizen's SSN is unique.
