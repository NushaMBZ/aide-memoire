# SQL

SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is a domain-specific programming language used for managing, manipulating, and querying relational databases.

## Data Definition Language
It is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) that is used to <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">define, manage, and control the structure and organization</mark> of a relational database.

1. **Creating Database Objects:**
    
    - **CREATE TABLE:** DDL is used to create new tables in a database.
      
    - **CREATE INDEX:** DDL is used to create indexes on one or more columns of a table to improve query performance.
      
    - **CREATE VIEW:** DDL can be used to create virtual tables (views) based on one or more existing tables. 
      
2. **Altering Database Objects:**
    
    - **ALTER TABLE:** DDL statements can be used to modify the structure of an existing table. 
      
    - **ALTER INDEX:** DDL allows for altering existing indexes, such as adding or dropping index columns.
      
    - **ALTER VIEW:** DDL can be used to modify the definition of an existing view.
3. **Dropping Database Objects:**
    
    - **DROP TABLE:** DDL is used to delete an existing table and all its data. 
      
    - **DROP INDEX:** DDL is used to delete an existing index.
      
    - **DROP VIEW:** DDL is used to delete an existing view.

## Data Manipulation Language

It is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) that is used for managing and manipulating data within a relational database.

1. **SELECT Statement:** The primary DML statement for <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">retrieving data</mark> is the SELECT statement. 
    
2. **INSERT Statement:** DML includes the INSERT statement, which is used to <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">add new rows (records)</mark> of data into a table.
    
3. **UPDATE Statement:** DML includes the UPDATE statement, which is used to <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">modify existing data</mark> in a table. 
    
4. **DELETE Statement:** DML includes the DELETE statement, which is used to <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">remove rows from a table</mark> based on specified conditions.


## Data Control Language
It is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) that is used to <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">control and manage permissions and access to data</mark> in a relational database.

1. **GRANT Statement:** The GRANT statement is used to <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">give specific privileges or permissions</mark> to users or roles in a database.
    
2. **REVOKE Statement:** The REVOKE statement is used to <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">take away previously granted privileges or permissions</mark> from users or roles.
