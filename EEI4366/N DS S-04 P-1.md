# Structured, Semi-structured Data

1. **Structured Data:**
    
    - **Definition:** Structured data is<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;"> highly organized and conforms to a well-defined and fixed schema or data model.</mark> 
        
    - **Examples:** Relational databases are a common example of structured data. 
        
    - **Characteristics:**
        
        - Data is organized into tables or entities.
        - Each column or field has a predefined data type.
        - Data relationships are established using keys and foreign keys.
        - Querying and searching are efficient due to the predictable structure.
          
    - **Use Cases:** Structured data is suitable for scenarios where data consistency and strict organization are essential, such as financial records, customer data, and inventory management.
        
2. **Semi-Structured Data:**
    
    - **Definition:** Semi-structured data is <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">less rigidly organized compared to structured data.</mark> It lacks a fixed schema but retains some level of structure, often using metadata or tags to describe the data's elements and relationships.
        
    - **Examples:** Common examples of semi-structured data formats include XML (Extensible Markup Language), JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), and HTML (Hypertext Markup Language).
        
    - **Characteristics:**
        
        - Data is self-descriptive through metadata or tags.
        - Elements within the data can vary in structure and may not conform to a strict schema.
        - Relationships between elements can be established through hierarchical or nested structures.
        - Schema evolution is more flexible compared to structured data.
          
    - **Use Cases:** Semi-structured data is well-suited for scenarios where data structures may evolve over time, such as in web content, social media posts, configuration files, and data exchanged between different systems or platforms.
        

Here are some additional points to consider:

- **Flexibility:** Structured data offers little flexibility in terms of data structure changes, while semi-structured data allows for more adaptability as new elements or fields can be introduced without breaking the schema.
    
- **Readability:** Structured data is typically more readable by machines due to its fixed schema, whereas semi-structured data is often more human-readable and easier to work with in diverse contexts.
    
- **Querying:** Querying structured data is straightforward because of its well-defined structure, whereas querying semi-structured data may require specialized tools or techniques to navigate its varying structure.
    
- **Scalability:** Semi-structured data is often more scalable for handling data sources with unpredictable or evolving structures, making it suitable for big data and NoSQL databases.

# XML

XML (Extensible Markup Language) is a <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">versatile and widely-used markup language that serves as a standard format for encoding and structuring data</mark> in a human-readable and machine-readable manner.

## XML Tree

An XML tree, often referred to as an XML document tree, is a hierarchical data structure used to represent the structure and content of an XML (Extensible Markup Language) document.

1. **XML Document:**
    
    - An XML document is a <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">collection of structured data</mark> enclosed within an opening root element and a corresponding closing root element.
    - The root element serves as <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">the starting point of the XML tree and encapsulates all other elements</mark> in the document.
2. **Elements:**
    
    - Elements are the fundamental building blocks of an XML tree.
    - Elements consist of an opening tag, content (which can include other elements or text data), and a closing tag.
    - Elements can be nested within other elements, creating a parent-child relationship and forming a hierarchical structure.
3. **Attributes:**
    
    - Elements can have attributes that provide additional information about the element itself.
    - Attributes are specified within the opening tag and follow a name-value pair format.
    - Attributes do not affect the hierarchical structure of the XML tree but provide metadata for elements.
4. **Hierarchy:**
    
    - XML documents are organized hierarchically, with elements arranged in a parent-child relationship.
    - The root element is the top-level element and serves as the parent for all other elements in the document.
    - Child elements are contained within their parent elements, creating a tree-like structure.
5. **XML Namespace:**
    
    - XML namespaces are used to avoid naming conflicts when elements or attributes with the same name are used in different contexts.
    - Namespaces are defined using a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) and are declared at the beginning of the XML document.

```

## XML Syntax Rules

1. **Case Sensitivity:**
    
    - XML is case-sensitive. Element names, attribute names, and values are treated as distinct based on their case (e.g., `<book>` and `<Book>` are different elements).
2. **Well-Formedness:**
    
    - Every XML document must be well-formed, which means it adheres to the basic syntactical rules of XML. A well-formed XML document must:
        - Have a single root element that encloses all other elements.
        - Use properly nested opening and closing tags for elements.
        - Quote attribute values using single or double quotes (e.g., `attribute="value"` or `attribute='value'`).
        - Use self-closing tags for empty elements (e.g., `<emptyElement />`).
3. **Element Nesting:**
    
    - XML elements must be properly nested within each other. Every opening tag must have a corresponding closing tag, and they should not overlap or cross boundaries.
4. **Root Element:**
    
    - An XML document must have one and only one root element. All other elements must be descendants of this root element.
5. **Reserved Characters:**
    
    - Certain characters have special meanings in XML and must be escaped when used as content. These characters are:
        - `<` (less than): Use `&lt;` or `<![CDATA[<]]>` for content containing `<`.
        - `>` (greater than): Use `&gt;` or `<![CDATA[>]]>` for content containing `>`.
        - `&` (ampersand): Use `&amp;` or `<![CDATA[&]]>` for content containing `&`.
        - `"` (double quote): Use `&quot;` for content containing double quotes.
        - `'` (single quote): Use `&apos;` for content containing single quotes.
6. **Attribute Syntax:**
    
    - Attributes must have a name followed by an equal sign and a value enclosed in double or single quotes (e.g., `attribute="value"` or `attribute='value'`).
7. **Whitespace Handling:**
    
    - Leading and trailing white spaces within elements are preserved. However, multiple consecutive white spaces are treated as a single space character, and line breaks are normalized to a single space.
8. **Comments:**
    
    - Comments are enclosed within `<!--` and `-->`. They can span multiple lines and are ignored by XML parsers.
9. **Processing Instructions:**
    
    - Processing instructions start with `<?` and end with `?>`. They provide instructions to the XML processor but are not treated as data.
10. **CDATA Sections:**
    
    - CDATA sections are used to include character data that should not be parsed by the XML processor. They start with `<![CDATA[` and end with `]]>`.
11. **Entity References:**
    
    - Certain characters and symbols can be represented using predefined entity references (e.g., `&lt;` for `<` or `&amp;` for `&`). Additionally, you can define custom entity references in a Document Type Definition (DTD) if needed.
12. **Namespace Declarations:**
    
    - If namespaces are used, they should be declared at the beginning of the XML document using the `xmlns` attribute.
13. **Character Encoding Declaration:**
    
    - The character encoding of the XML document should be declared using the `<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>` declaration (or the appropriate encoding).

> [!note]
> While XML attributes are a legitimate and useful part of the XML specification, there are cases where it may be advisable to avoid or limit their use in favor of using XML elements.

# XPath

XPath (XML Path Language) is a powerful and versatile language used for navigating and querying XML documents. It provides a standardized way to locate and manipulate elements and data within an XML document.

1. **XPath in XSLT:** XPath is indeed a fundamental component of XSLT (eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformations), which is a language for transforming XML documents into different formats or structures.
    
2. **Navigating Elements and Attributes:** XPath is used to navigate through elements and attributes within an XML document, allowing you to pinpoint specific data or elements.
    
3. **XPath Expressions:** XPath expressions are used to specify patterns for selecting elements or data within an XML document. These expressions can return a sequence of items that match the specified criteria.
    
4. **Path Separators:** XPath uses two main path separators:
    
    - Single Slash (`/`): Specifies that the tag must appear as a direct child of the previous (parent) tag in the hierarchy.
    - Double Slash (`//`): Specifies that the tag can appear as a descendant of the previous tag at any level in the hierarchy.

# XQuery

XQuery is a powerful and expressive query and transformation language designed for querying and manipulating XML data. It provides a standardized way to extract, filter, transform, and generate XML content, making it well-suited for working with complex XML documents and databases.

1. **XML-Focused:** XQuery is specifically designed for querying and processing XML data. It operates on XML documents and can handle both well-structured and semi-structured XML data.
    
2. **XPath Integration:** XQuery builds upon XPath, incorporating XPath expressions as a core component for selecting nodes within XML documents. XPath expressions are used extensively within XQuery to navigate and filter XML content.
    
3. **Functional Language:** XQuery is a functional programming language, which means it treats queries as functions that transform input data into output data. It supports variables, functions, and recursion.
    
4. **Expressive Query Capabilities:** XQuery supports a wide range of query capabilities, including:
    
    - Selecting nodes and values from XML documents.
    - Filtering and sorting results.
    - Joining and merging data from multiple XML sources.
    - Aggregating data using functions like `count()`, `sum()`, `avg()`, and more.
    - Conditional statements and branching.
    - User-defined functions and modules.
5. **FLWOR Expressions:** XQuery introduces the FLWOR expression (For-Let-Where-Order-Return), which is a powerful construct for specifying queries and transformations in a structured and readable way.
    
6. **XML Output:** XQuery can produce XML output, making it suitable for generating new XML documents or transforming existing ones. It can also generate other formats, such as JSON, HTML, and plain text.
    
7. **XQuery Update Facility:** Some XQuery implementations include an XQuery Update Facility, which allows for modifying XML data in addition to querying it. This feature enables the insertion, deletion, and modification of nodes in XML documents.
    
8. **Standardization:** XQuery is a W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) recommendation, ensuring that it is a standardized and widely supported technology.


> [!note]
> The typical form of a query in XQuery is known as a FLWOR expression which stands for the five main clauses of XQuery and has the following form:

```xquery
for $book in //book
where $book/price > 25
return $book/title/text()
```

## SQL Functions for Creating XML Data

- **XMLELEMENT:** The `XMLELEMENT` function is used to s<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">pecify a tag (element) name that will appear in the resulting XML.</mark> It can be used to create XML elements representing complex structures or individual columns. For example:

```mysql
SELECT XMLELEMENT(NAME "book", title) FROM books;
```

- **XMLFOREST:** `XMLFOREST` simplifies the process of <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">creating multiple XML elements by allowing you to list column names directly</mark>, separated by commas.

```mysql
SELECT XMLFOREST(title AS "book_title", author AS "book_author") FROM books;
```

- **XMLAGG:** The `XMLAGG` function is used to group several elements together, creating a collection of subelements under a parent element.
```mysql
SELECT XMLELEMENT(NAME "library", XMLAGG(XMLELEMENT(NAME "book", title))) FROM books;
```

- **XMLROOT:** `XMLROOT` allows you to format selected elements as an XML document with a single root element.
```mysql
SELECT XMLROOT(XMLELEMENT(NAME "book", title), VERSION '1.0', STANDALONE YES) FROM books;
```
- **XMLATTRIBUTES:** The `XMLATTRIBUTES` function is used to create attributes for XML elements.
```mysql
SELECT XMLELEMENT(NAME "book", title, XMLATTRIBUTES(ISBN AS "id")) FROM books;
```

# DTD

XML DTD (Document Type Definition) is a document structure specification that defines the structure and the legal elements and attributes of an XML document.

```dtd
<!DOCTYPE library [
    <!ELEMENT library (book+)>
    <!ELEMENT book (title, author, publication_year)>
    <!ATTLIST book ISBN CDATA #REQUIRED>
    <!ELEMENT title (#PCDATA)>
    <!ELEMENT author (#PCDATA)>
    <!ELEMENT publication_year (#PCDATA)>
]>
```

- `PCDATA` means that the element can contain character data that is parsed by the XML processor.
- Contents of a `CDATA` section are treated as literal character data and are not subject to XML parsing rules.
