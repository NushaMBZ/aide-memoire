# Enhanced ER (EER) Model

The EER model introduces additional concepts and notations to provide a more robust and expressive way to represent the structure and relationships in a database.

## Subtypes and Supertypes

EER allows for the modeling of hierarchical relationships between entity types.

1. **Supertype:** A supertype is a generalized entity type that represents a broader category or class of entities.
    
2. **Subtype:** A subtype is a specialized entity type that inherits attributes and characteristics from its supertype.
## Specialization and Generalization

In the EER model, specialization is used to create subtypes from a supertype and generalization to create a supertype from subtypes. 

### **Specialization:**

Specialization is the process of creating subtypes from a supertype, thereby dividing a more general entity type (the supertype) into more specific categories (the subtypes).
   
### **Generalization:**
 
Generalization is the reverse process of specialization. It involves <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">creating a more general entity type (the supertype) by abstracting common attributes and relationships from several subtypes.</mark>

#### Types

The three types of constraints on generalization are:
1. **Membership constraints**
2. **Disjoint constraints**
3. **Completeness constraints**


##### membership constraints
These <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">constraints determine which entities can be members of a subclass.</mark> There are two types of membership constraints:
    
- **<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Condition-defined membership constraints</mark>(Predicate):** <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">These constraints are defined using a Boolean expression. </mark> For example, a condition-defined membership constraint could be used to specify that only employees who are over the age of 18 can be members of the `Manager` subclass.

- **<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">User-defined membership constraints</mark>:** These constraints are defined by <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">the database designer using a custom function.</mark> User-defined membership constraints can be used to implement complex membership criteria that cannot be expressed using condition-defined membership constraints.
      
##### Disjoint constraints
Disjoint <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">constraints specify whether or not entities can belong to more than one subclass.</mark> There are two types of disjoint constraints:
    
- **<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Disjoint constraint</mark>:** This constraint specifies that entities <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">can only belong to one subclass.</mark>
  ![[Pasted image 20231030123507.png]]
- **<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Overlapping constraint</mark>:** This constraint specifies that entities <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">can belong to multiple subclasses.</mark>
  ![[Pasted image 20231030123455.png]]
      
##### Completeness constraints
Completeness <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">constraints specify whether or not all entities in the superclass must belong to at least one subclass.</mark> There are two types of completeness constraints:
    
- **<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Total completeness constraint</mark>:** This constraint specifies that <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">all entities in the superclass must belong to at least one subclass.</mark>
- **<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Partial completeness constraint</mark>:** This constraint specifies that <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">some entities in the superclass may not belong to any subclass.</mark>

## Union Types 

A union type is an entity type that <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">encompasses entities that can be classified into multiple, usually non-overlapping, entity types.</mark> 

> [!note]
> It is a way to represent the idea that certain entities do not neatly fit into a single category but exhibit characteristics from multiple categories.

Union types are particularly valuable in modeling scenarios where entities can possess attributes or relationships from different domains or categories. 

> [!example]
> Consider a database for a library. Books could be categorized into genres like "Mystery," "Science Fiction," and "Romance." However, a book can belong to multiple genres simultaneously, such as a "Mystery" and "Science Fiction" book. 

## Overlapping and Disjoint Constraints 

EER allows to specify constraints on subtype relationships, indicating whether subtypes can have overlapping or disjoint sets of entities.

### Overlapping Constraints 

Overlapping constraints <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">allow entities to belong to more than one subtype simultaneously. 
</mark>
Overlapping constraints are typically used when there are shared characteristics or attributes among subtypes, and entities can have multiple roles or characteristics that do not conflict with each other. 
![[Pasted image 20231030125546.png]]
> [!example] 
> In a database for a retail store, you might have subtypes for "Regular Customers" and "Online Customers." Some customers may belong to both subtypes, as they can be both regular in-store shoppers and online customers.

1. **Overlapping, Total:**
    
    - In an "overlapping, total" class hierarchy,<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> instances of the superclass are allowed to belong to multiple subclasses simultaneously.</mark> All instances are assigned to more than one subclass. This is often used when there are real-world cases where objects exhibit properties or characteristics from multiple classes.
	- In an "overlapping, total" scenario, animal instances can belong to multiple categories simultaneously. Every instance belongs to more than one subclass.

> [!Example]
> - Animal: "Platypus" → Belongs to both "Mammals" and "Birds" because of its unique characteristics, like laying eggs and having fur.
2. **Overlapping, Partial:**
    
    - In an "overlapping, partial" class hierarchy,<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> instances of the superclass can belong to multiple subclasses, but it's not mandatory for them to belong to any subclass.</mark> Some instances may not belong to any subclass, while others may belong to multiple subclasses.
	- In an "overlapping, partial" scenario, animal instances can belong to multiple categories, but they are not required to. Some instances may not belong to any subclass, and some may belong to multiple.

> [!Example]
>   - Animal: "Lion" → Belongs to "Mammals."
>   - Animal: "Penguin" → Belongs to "Birds."
>    - Animal: "Duck-billed Platypus" → Belongs to both "Mammals" and "Birds" because of its unique features.
>   - Animal: "Fish" → Doesn't belong to "Mammals" or "Birds."

### Disjoint Constraints

Disjoint constraints dictate that <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">an entity can belong to only one subtype at a time. </mark>
![[Pasted image 20231030125533.png]]
Disjoint constraints are used when the subtypes represent mutually exclusive categories, and an entity cannot simultaneously exhibit characteristics of more than one subtype. 

>[!example]
>In a database for a car rental company, you might have subtypes for "Sedans" and "SUVs." If an entity is a vehicle, it can belong to either the "Sedans" subtype or the "SUVs" subtype but not both because a car cannot be both a sedan and an SUV at the same time.

1. **Disjoint, Total:**
    
    - In this context, when we say a class hierarchy is "disjoint, total," it means <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">that the instances (objects) of the superclass must belong to exactly one of the subclasses.</mark> There is no overlap or sharing of instances between subclasses. Each instance is unambiguously assigned to a single subclass.
	- In a "disjoint, total" scenario, every animal instance must belong to either the "Mammals" or "Birds" category but not both. There is no overlap.

>[!Example]
> - Animal: "Lion" → Belongs to the "Mammals" category.
> - Animal: "Eagle" → Belongs to the "Birds" category.
> - No instance can belong to both "Mammals" and "Birds."

2. **Disjoint, Partial:**
    
    - In a "disjoint, partial" class hierarchy, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">instances of the superclass can belong to one or more of the subclasses, but they are not required to belong to any of them.</mark> So, there is some overlap or sharing of instances between the subclasses, but it's not mandatory for an instance to belong to any subclass.
	- In a "disjoint, partial" scenario, animal instances can belong to either "Mammals," "Birds," both, or neither. Some overlap is allowed.

> [!Example]
> Animal: "Lion" → Belongs to the "Mammals" category.
>- Animal: "Eagle" → Belongs to the "Birds" category.
>- Animal: "Dolphin" → Can belong to both "Mammals" and "Birds."
>- Animal: "Fish" → Doesn't belong to "Mammals" or "Birds."
