## **Logical data independence**

#Q #AOSR/4hgb6
Logical data independence :: is the ability to change the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">logical schema of a database without affecting the external schema or the application programs that use the database.</mark> #AOSR/4hgb6/s/69fd
#/Q
**Example:**

Suppose we have a database of customer information. The logical schema might include the following entities:

- Customer
- Order
- Product

Each entity would have a set of attributes, such as:

- Customer: customer ID, name, address, phone number
- Order: order ID, customer ID, order date, total amount
- Product: product ID, name, description, price

We could also have relationships between entities, such as:

- A customer can place many orders.
- An order can have many products.

## **Physical data independence**

#Q #AOSR/5saq4
Physical data independence :: is the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">ability to change the physical schema of a database without affecting the logical schema or the application programs that use the database.</mark>  #AOSR/5saq4/s/7d7d #AOSR/4hgb6/s/7geu

**Example:**
Suppose we have a database of customer information and we store the data in a set of flat files. If we decide to change the way the data is stored, such as using a relational database or a NoSQL database, we should be able to do so without affecting the logical schema or the application programs that use the database.

This is possible because the DBMS provides a layer of abstraction between the physical schema and the logical schema. The DBMS automatically translates queries from the logical schema to the physical schema and vice versa.

**Benefits of logical and physical data independence**

Logical and physical data independence offer a number of benefits, including:
- Increased flexibility: Logical and physical data independence make it easier to change the database structure without affecting the application programs that use the database.
- Improved maintainability: Logical and physical data independence can make it easier to maintain the database.
- Increased performance: Logical and physical data independence can help to improve the performance of the database by allowing the DBMS to choose the most efficient way to store and retrieve data.


# Three-tier architecture

#Q #AOSR/5evq0
Three-tier architecture :: is a <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">client-server architecture that separates the user interface, application processing, and data management</mark> into three distinct tiers or layers: #AOSR/5evq0/s/5hua #AOSR/4hgb6/s/2bpd
 #Q
- Presentation tier:: The presentation tier is the user interface or client layer of the application. It is responsible for <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">presenting data to the user and receiving input from the user.</mark> #AOSR/5evq0/s/28eu #AOSR/4hgb6/s/1e87
 #Q
- Application tier:: The application tier is the business logic layer. It is responsible for <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">processing user requests and generating responses. </mark>The application tier also interacts with the database tier to retrieve and store data. #AOSR/5evq0/s/7rji
  #Q
- Database tier:: The database tier is the data storage layer. It is responsible for <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">storing and managing the data that the application uses.</mark> #AOSR/5evq0/s/190o


## Direct File Organization

#Q #AOSR/6knhc
Direct file organization :: is a file organization method in which each <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">record in a file is directly mapped to a specific storage location</mark> on the disk. #AOSR/6knhc/s/370f #AOSR/4hgb6/s/v5g6

#Q
Advantages of direct file organization
- **Fast access:** Direct file organization allows ==for very fast access to individual records,== since the storage location of each record is known in advance.
- **Simple implementation:** Direct file organization is ==relatively simple to implement and use.==

#Q #AOSR/t80p3
Disadvantages of direct file organization:
- **Inefficient space usage:** Direct file organization can be ==inefficient in terms of space usage== #AOSR/t80p3/c/37nc , since the file must be large enough to store all of the possible records, even if some of them are not actually present.
- **Susceptibility to fragmentation:** Direct file organization is ==susceptible to fragmentation==, which can occur when records are deleted and inserted from the file.


### In-Direct File Organization

#Q #AOSR/7uvuu
**Indirect file organization** is a file organization method in which ==each record in a file is mapped to a storage location indirectly through an index table.== #AOSR/7uvuu/c/3d1c 

#Q #AOSR/1csgt
**Advantages of indirect file organization:**
- **Efficient space usage:** Indirect file organization is ==more efficient in terms of space usage== #AOSR/1csgt/c/55su  than direct file organization, since the file only needs to be large enough to store the actual records, not all of the possible records.
- **Less susceptible to fragmentation:** Indirect file organization is ==less susceptible to fragmentation than direct file organization==, since records can be inserted and deleted without affecting the storage locations of other records.

#Q
**Disadvantages of indirect file organization:**
- **Slower access:** Indirect file organization is ==slower than direct file organization,== since the storage location of each record must be looked up in the index table before the record can be accessed.
- **More complex implementation:** Indirect file organization is ==more complex to implement== and use than direct file organization.
