# Views

This is a virtual table that is derived from the data in one or more physical tables. Views do not store data themselves but instead provide a way to present data stored in tables in a different, more structured, or simplified format.

```sql
CREATE VIEW EmployeeInfo AS
SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Department
FROM Employees;
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM EmployeeInfo;
```

# Trigger

In SQL, a trigger is a set of instructions or actions that are automatically executed by the database management system (DBMS) when a specific event occurs.

## Key Points

1. **Event-Based:** Triggers are associated with specific events, such as data changes in a table (e.g., an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE operation). 
    
2. **Timing:** Triggers can be defined to execute either before the triggering event (BEFORE trigger) or after the triggering event (AFTER trigger).
    
3. **Table-Specific:** Triggers are defined on a specific table, and they are triggered by events that occur on that table. 
    
4. **Procedural Code:** Triggers are typically written in a procedural language specific to the DBMS, such as PL/SQL for Oracle, T-SQL for Microsoft SQL Server, or PL/pgSQL for PostgreSQL. 
    
5. **Use Cases:**
    
    - Data Validation: Triggers can be used to enforce data integrity rules.
    - Audit Trails: Triggers are often used to log changes made to a table, tracking who made the changes and when they occurred.
    - Cascading Updates: Triggers can be used to automatically update related tables when changes are made to a primary table.
    - Business Logic: Triggers can encapsulate complex business logic, automating processes that need to occur with specific data changes.

## Types

1. **BEFORE Trigger:**
    
    - A BEFORE trigger is executed before the triggering event (e.g., INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) is applied to the table.
    - It can be used for data validation, modification, or cancellation of the triggering event.
    - A common use case is to check data integrity or modify data before it is written to the table.

```sql
-- Creating a BEFORE INSERT trigger
CREATE TRIGGER SetCreationDate
BEFORE INSERT ON Products
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    SET NEW.CreatedAt = NOW();
END;
```

1. **AFTER Trigger:**
    
    - An AFTER trigger is executed after the triggering event has been applied to the table.
    - It is often used for logging, auditing, or performing actions that depend on the success of the triggering event.
    - This type of trigger is frequently used for tasks like recording changes to a table in an audit log.

```sql
-- Creating an AFTER INSERT trigger for logging
CREATE TRIGGER LogNewProduct
AFTER INSERT ON Products
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO ProductAuditLog (ProductID, Action, ActionDate)
    VALUES (NEW.ProductID, 'INSERT', NOW());
END;
```

3. **INSTEAD OF Trigger:**
    
    - An INSTEAD OF trigger is mainly used with views. When an action (e.g., INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) is performed on a view, an INSTEAD OF trigger is executed instead of the default action on the underlying table.
    - It allows you to define custom actions when modifying the data through a view, effectively intercepting and handling the action in a different way.

```sql
-- Creating an INSTEAD OF UPDATE trigger for a view
CREATE TRIGGER InsteadOfUpdateView
INSTEAD OF UPDATE ON ViewName
BEGIN
    -- Custom update logic here
END;
```
