# Views

This is a virtual table that is derived from the data in one or more physical tables. Views do not store data themselves but instead provide a way to present data stored in tables in a different, more structured, or simplified format.

```mysql
CREATE VIEW EmployeeInfo AS
SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Department
FROM Employees;
```

```mysql
SELECT * FROM EmployeeInfo;
```

**Advantages of views**

- **Data abstraction and simplification:** Views can be used to abstract away the complexity of underlying tables and relationships, making it easier for users to query the data without having to know the underlying database structure.
- **Data filtering and security:** Views can be used to filter the data that is visible to users, providing a layer of security and restricting access to sensitive data.
- **Performance:** Views can improve performance by caching frequently used queries.
- **Maintainability:** Views can make code more maintainable by encapsulating complex queries and making them reusable.

**Disadvantages of views**

- **Performance:** Views can also degrade performance if they are not properly designed and optimized.
- **Complexity:** Views can become complex and difficult to understand, especially if they are nested or contain complex logic.
- **Synchronization:** Views must be synchronized with the underlying tables to ensure that the data is always up-to-date.

# Trigger

In SQL, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">a trigger is a set of instructions or actions that are automatically executed by the database management system (DBMS) when a specific event occurs.</mark>

## Key Points

1. **Event-Based:** Triggers are associated with specific events, such as data changes in a table (e.g., an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE operation). 
    
2. **Timing:** Triggers can be defined to execute either before the triggering event (BEFORE trigger) or after the triggering event (AFTER trigger).
    
3. **Table-Specific:** Triggers are defined on a specific table, and they are triggered by events that occur on that table. 
    
4. **Procedural Code:** Triggers are typically written in a procedural language specific to the DBMS, such as PL/SQL for Oracle, T-SQL for Microsoft SQL Server, or PL/pgSQL for PostgreSQL. 
    
5. **Use Cases:**
    
    - Data Validation: Triggers can be used to enforce data integrity rules.
    - Audit Trails: Triggers are often used to log changes made to a table, tracking who made the changes and when they occurred.
    - Cascading Updates: Triggers can be used to automatically update related tables when changes are made to a primary table.
    - Business Logic: Triggers can encapsulate complex business logic, automating processes that need to occur with specific data changes.

## Types

1. **BEFORE Trigger:**
    
    - A BEFORE trigger is executed before the triggering event (e.g., INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) is applied to the table.
    - It can be used for data validation, modification, or cancellation of the triggering event.
    - A common use case is to check data integrity or modify data before it is written to the table.

```sql
DELIMITER //

CREATE TRIGGER SetCreationDate
BEFORE INSERT ON Products
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
  SET NEW.CreatedAt = NOW();
END //

DELIMITER ;
```

2. **AFTER Trigger:**
    
    - An AFTER trigger is executed after the triggering event has been applied to the table.
    - It is often used for logging, auditing, or performing actions that depend on the success of the triggering event.
    - This type of trigger is frequently used for tasks like recording changes to a table in an audit log.

```sql
DELIMITER //

CREATE TRIGGER LogNewProduct
AFTER INSERT ON Products
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO ProductAuditLog (ProductID, Action, ActionDate)
  VALUES (NEW.ProductID, 'INSERT', NOW());
END //

DELIMITER ;

```
