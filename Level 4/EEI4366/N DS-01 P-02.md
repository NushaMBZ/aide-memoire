# Database Normalization

Database normalization is a systematic process in database design that aims to <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity</mark> by organizing data into separate tables and structuring those tables in a way that minimizes duplication of information.


## Anomalies

Irregularities or issues that can occur when data is not organized or structured optimally.

These anomalies can lead to inconsistencies, errors, and inefficiencies in database operations. There are three common types of anomalies:

1. **Insertion Anomalies:** Insertion anomalies occur when you attempt to add new data to a database, and you encounter difficulties because of the database's structure. These anomalies often arise in non-normalized or poorly designed databases. For example:
    
    - Adding a new record may fail if it doesn't include values for all required fields.
    - Adding data for an entity with multiple relationships can lead to duplicating information or entering data that doesn't belong in that entity.
2. **Update Anomalies:** Update anomalies happen when you need to change data within the database and encounter issues due to its structure. Common scenarios include:
    
    - Updating an attribute for one entity might require updating the same information in multiple places, leading to inconsistencies or errors.
    - If you don't update all instances of related data simultaneously, you might end up with inconsistent or contradictory information.
3. **Deletion Anomalies:** Deletion anomalies occur when you attempt to remove data from the database and face difficulties due to its design. In some cases:
    
    - Deleting one record may lead to unintentional loss of related data, which might still be relevant for other records.
    - Deleting a record might not be possible if it's related to other data, which can lead to clutter and inefficiency in the database.

> [!note]
> Functional dependencies are relationships between attributes in a relational database.


## Functional Dependency

A functional dependency is a relationship between two sets of attributes in a relation, such that the value of one set of attributes (the determinant) uniquely determines the value of the other set of attributes (the dependent).

> [!example]
> In a table of employees, the employee ID number (determinant) uniquely determines the employee's name, address, and other personal information (dependent).
## Transitive Dependency

A transitive dependency is a type of functional dependency where one attribute is indirectly dependent on another attribute through a third attribute.

> [!example]
> If attribute A is dependent on attribute B, and attribute B is dependent on attribute C, then attribute A is also dependent on attribute C.

## Multi-valued Dependency

This is a type of functional dependency <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">where two or more attributes are dependent on another attribute, but are independent of each other.</mark>

> [!example]
> In other words, if attribute A is dependent on attribute B, and attribute B is dependent on attribute C, but attribute A is not dependent on attribute C, then there is an MVD between attribute A and attribute B.

## Join Dependencies

A particular type of dependency that arises <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">when a relation (table) can be reconstructed by joining two or more smaller relations based on a common attribute or set of attributes.</mark>

>[!example]
> A JD is a relationship between two or more sets of attributes in a relation, such that the value of one set of attributes can be uniquely determined by joining the values of the other sets of attributes.


## **Superkey**

A superkey is a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">set of attributes (columns) that can uniquely identify a row in our database.</mark> 
   
## **Partial Dependency**

This is when a piece of data depends on only part of a superkey. For instance, if the student's grade depends only on the course, not on the student ID, that's a partial dependency.

## Levels of Normalization

There are several normal forms, with the most common ones being the first three. Here are the levels of normalization:

### First Normal Form (1NF)

First Normal Form (1NF) is the initial step in the process of normalizing a relational database. It ensures that a table meets certain basic criteria for organizing data. To achieve 1NF, a table must have the following properties:

1. Each table cell (intersection of a row and column) <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">should contain a single, indivisible value.</mark> There should be no repeating groups or arrays of data within a cell.
    
2. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">All entries in a column should be of the same data type.</mark>
    
3. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Each column should have a unique name.</mark>
    
4. The order of the rows and columns should not affect the data's interpretation. In other words, the table should be unordered.

Here's an example of transforming a non-1NF table into 1NF with decomposition:

Suppose you have a non-1NF table called "OrderInfo" that records orders and the items within each order. It might look like this:

|OrderID | Customer | Items|
|---------|-------|-----------|
|1001   | Alice    | Item1, Item2, Item3|
|1002   | Bob      | Item2, Item4|

In this non-1NF table, the "Items" column contains multiple values (Item1, Item2, etc.) within a single cell, and it's not in 1NF.

To bring this table into 1NF, you can decompose it into two separate tables: one for orders and another for items. Here's how you can do it:

**Orders Table (OrderInfo):**

|OrderID | Customer|
|----------|-------|
|1001   | Alice|
|1002   | Bob|

**OrderItems Table (OrderItemsInfo):**

|OrderID | Item|
|-------|------|
|1001   | Item1|
|1001   | Item2|
|1001   | Item3|
|1002   | Item2|
|1002   | Item4|

Now, the data is organized in 1NF:

1. Each table cell contains a single, indivisible value.
2. All entries in each column have the same data type.
3. Each column has a unique name.
4. The order of rows and columns does not affect the data's interpretation.

This decomposition simplifies the structure, eliminates data redundancy, and makes it easier to work with the data. It also allows you to establish relationships between the two tables, reflecting the actual relationships between orders and items in a more structured and normalized way.

### Second Normal Form (2NF)

**Second Normal Form (2NF)** is a level of database normalization that builds upon the concepts of the First Normal Form (1NF). 2NF further eliminates redundancy by addressing partial dependencies in a table. To be in 2NF, a table must meet the following requirements:

1. It <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">must be in 1NF</mark>, meaning that each column contains atomic (indivisible) values, and the order of rows and columns doesn't matter.
2. It <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">should not have partial dependencies</mark>, which means that no non-key attribute (non-prime attribute) should depend on only part of the primary key. All <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">non-key attributes should depend on the entire primary key.</mark>

To explain 2NF, let's use an example:

Suppose you have a table called "Sales" with the following attributes: OrderID, ProductID, ProductName, and SalesAmount.

Sales:

| OrderID | ProductID | ProductName | SalesAmount |
| ------- | --------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 1001    | 101       | Widget A    | $100        |
| 1001    | 102       | Widget B    | $75         |
| 1002    | 101       | Widget A    | $90         |

In this table, the primary key is (OrderID, ProductID), which represents a composite key. However, there is a partial dependency issue because the ProductName attribute depends only on the ProductID, which is part of the primary key. This violates the 2NF rule.

To bring this table into 2NF, you can decompose it into two tables: one for sales and another for products.

**Sales Table (SalesInfo):**

|OrderID | ProductID | SalesAmount| 
|-------|-------------|------------| 
|1001 | 101 | $100 |
|1001 | 102 | $75 |
|1002 | 101 | $90|

**Products Table (ProductInfo):**

|ProductID | ProductName |
|----------|-------------| 
|101 | Widget A |
|102 | Widget B|

Now, the data is in 2NF:

1. Each table cell contains a single, atomic value (1NF).
2. There are no partial dependencies. ProductName depends on the full ProductID, and SalesAmount depends on the full composite key (OrderID, ProductID).

By decomposing the original table into these two tables, you've eliminated partial dependencies and created a more organized and normalized database structure, making it easier to maintain and query the data while reducing redundancy. This separation also allows for more efficient updates and inserts when managing sales and products.



### **Third Normal Form (3NF)**

This is a level of database normalization that builds upon the concepts of the First Normal Form (1NF) and Second Normal Form (2NF). It <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">eliminates transitive dependencies</mark> within a relational database. To achieve 3NF, a table must meet the following criteria:

1. It <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">must be in 2NF,</mark> meaning it is already in 1NF and has no partial dependencies.
    
2. It <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">should not have any transitive dependencies.</mark> This means that no non-prime (non-key) attribute should depend on another non-prime attribute within the same table. Non-prime attributes should only depend on the primary key.
    

Let's illustrate 3NF with an example:

Suppose you have a table called "EmployeeInfo" with the following attributes: EmployeeID, EmployeeName, Department, and DepartmentHead.

|EmployeeID | EmployeeName | Department  | DepartmentHead|
|-----------|--------------|------------|-------------------|
|101       | Alice        | Marketing   | Alice|
|102       | Bob          | Sales       | Alice|
|103       | Carol        | Marketing   | Alice|


In this table, the primary key is EmployeeID. However, there is a transitive dependency issue. The DepartmentHead attribute depends on the Department, which, in turn, depends on the EmployeeName. This violates the 3NF rule.

To bring this table into 3NF, you can decompose it into two tables: one for employee information and another for department information.

**Employee Table (EmployeeInfo):**

|EmployeeID | EmployeeName|
|-----------|-------------|
|101       | Alice|
|102       | Bob|
|103       | Carol|

**Department Table (DepartmentInfo):**

|Department | DepartmentHead|
|-----|---------------------|
|Marketing  | Alice|
|Sales      | Alice|

Now, the data is in 3NF:

1. Each table cell contains a single, atomic value (1NF).
2. There are no partial dependencies (2NF).
3. There are no transitive dependencies within the EmployeeInfo table.

By decomposing the original table into these two tables, you've eliminated transitive dependencies and created a more organized and normalized database structure. This separation allows for more efficient updates and inserts and ensures that each piece of data is stored in only one place, reducing data redundancy and improving data integrity.



### Boycd Codd Normal Form

It's a property that ensures that a database table is well-structured and free from certain types of anomalies, particularly functional dependencies.

To be in BCNF, a table must meet two conditions:

1. It <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">must be in 1NF</mark>: This means that all attributes (columns) in the table are atomic and contain only indivisible values. There should be no repeating groups, arrays, or nested structures.
    
2. For every non-trivial functional dependency (X -> Y) in the table,<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> X must be a superkey</mark>. A superkey is a set of attributes that can uniquely identify a tuple (row) in the table. If X is not a superkey, the table is not in BCNF.

Let's illustrate this with an example:

Suppose we have a table called "StudentCourses" that records the courses students are enrolled in, with the following attributes:

- StudentID (Primary Key)
- CourseID (Primary Key)
- CourseName
- Instructor
- InstructorOffice

Here's the initial table:

```
StudentCourses (StudentID, CourseID, CourseName, Instructor, InstructorOffice)
```

Now, let's say there's a functional dependency where the instructor's office depends on the course:

- CourseID -> InstructorOffice

In this case, CourseID is not a superkey because it does not uniquely identify students (there can be multiple students in the same course). Therefore, the table is not in BCNF.

To bring this table into BCNF, we can decompose it into two separate tables: one for student-course relationships and another for course-instructor relationships.

1. StudentCourses (StudentID, CourseID)
2. Courses (CourseID, CourseName, Instructor, InstructorOffice)

Now, both tables are in BCNF:

- StudentCourses (StudentID, CourseID) because StudentID is a superkey.
- Courses (CourseID, CourseName, Instructor, InstructorOffice) because CourseID is a superkey.

This decomposition ensures that each table is in 1NF, and the functional dependencies are satisfied, adhering to the BCNF requirements. It also eliminates redundancy and maintains data integrity in the database.


### The Fourth Normal Form (4NF)

This is a level of database normalization that builds upon the concepts of the earlier normal forms (1NF, 2NF, and 3NF) to further eliminate redundancy and improve data integrity in a relational database.

A multi-valued dependency occurs when a single attribute's value depends on another attribute, but the dependency isn't based on a functional relationship. Instead, it signifies that a single value in one attribute can be associated with multiple values in another attribute.

To achieve 4NF, a table must already satisfy the requirements of 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF, and additionally, it should <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">not contain any non-trivial multi-valued dependencies. </mark>Here's a definition of 4NF:

A relational table is in 4NF if, for every non-trivial multi-valued dependency X -> Y, X is a superkey.

Let's illustrate 4NF with an example:

Suppose we have a table called "BookAuthors" that keeps track of books and their associated authors. Here's the initial table:

```
BookAuthors (BookID, Author, Genre)
```

In this table, we have a multi-valued dependency because a book can have multiple authors, and an author can be associated with multiple genres. For example, if we have a row like (Book1, AuthorA, GenreX), it implies that AuthorA is related to GenreX, and this is a multi-valued dependency.

To bring the "BookAuthors" table into 4NF, we can decompose it into two tables:

1. Books (BookID, Genre)
2. Authors (Author, BookID)

Now, both tables are in 4NF:

- The "Books" table contains information about books and their genres, and BookID is a superkey.
- The "Authors" table contains information about authors and the books they have written, and Author is a superkey.

This decomposition resolves the multi-valued dependency and ensures that each table is in 4NF, thus reducing redundancy and improving data integrity.

### Fifth Normal Form

This is a level of database normalization that is relatively advanced and less commonly used than the lower normal forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, and 4NF). 5NF primarily deals with the decomposition of complex multi-valued dependencies and joins between tables in a database schema.

In 5NF, the goal is to eliminate redundancy and ensure that the database schema is free from certain complex types of anomalies related to multi-valued dependencies. A multi-valued dependency occurs when an attribute's value is dependent on another attribute, but this dependency is not based on a functional relationship, and it represents more complex relationships between data.

To achieve 5NF, a table must first satisfy the requirements of 1NF, 2NF, 3NF, and 4NF. Specifically, a table must be in 4NF to progress to 5NF. The conditions for 5NF include:

1. The table <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">must be in 4NF,</mark> which means it does not contain any non-trivial multi-valued dependencies.
2. The table must <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">not contain any join dependencies.</mark>

A join dependency arises when a table <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">can be reconstructed by joining two or more tables.</mark> In 5NF, the goal is to eliminate such join dependencies by decomposing the table into its constituent components in a way that reduces redundancy and ensures data integrity.


### Domain Key Normal Form (DKNF)

This is a more advanced level of normalization in the field of database design, focusing on eliminating redundancy and ensuring data integrity. It goes beyond the commonly discussed First Normal Form (1NF), Second Normal Form (2NF), Third Normal Form (3NF), Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF), and even Fifth Normal Form (5NF).

DKNF specifically addresses issues related to candidate keys and constraints on attribute domains. To achieve DKNF, a table must meet the following conditions:

1. The table <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">must be in BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form),</mark> meaning that for every non-trivial functional dependency X -> Y, X is a superkey.
    
2. The table <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">must not have any partial dependencies.</mark> In other words, all non-key attributes must be functionally dependent on the entire primary key and not just part of it.
    
3. The table <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">must not have transitive dependencies,</mark> where an attribute is transitively dependent on the primary key through another non-key attribute.
    
4. The table <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">must have all attributes constrained to their specific domains.</mark> This ensures that each attribute contains only values that are allowed within its defined domain.

DKNF is a high level of normalization and is not always required or practical for all database designs. It is typically used in cases where data integrity and strict adherence to constraints are of utmost importance. Achieving DKNF may involve decomposing tables into smaller, related tables and defining explicit domain constraints to meet the above conditions.
