> Explain the following two relational concepts using a sample relation of your own choice providing suitable examples.

1. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Entity Integrity</mark> : It ensures the uniqueness and consistency of data within a relational database.


| EmployeeID | FirstName | LastName | DepartmentID | Salary |
| ---------- | --------- | -------- | ------------ | ------ |
| 101        | Alice     | Smith    | 1            | 50000  |
| 102        | Bob       | Johnson  | 2            | 60000  |
| 103        | Carol     | Davis    | 1            | 55000  |
| 104        | David     | Wilson   | 3            | 62000  |


|DepartmentID|DepartmentName|
|---|---|
|1|HR|
|2|Finance|
|3|IT|

In our "Employees" relation:

- EmployeeID serves as the primary key, ensuring the uniqueness of each employee's record.
- Entity Integrity ensures that no two employees have the same EmployeeID, preventing duplicate records.

2. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Referential Integrity</mark>: It ensures the consistency of relationships between tables.

- The "DepartmentID" column in the "Employees" table is a foreign key that references the "DepartmentID" column in the "Departments" table.
  
- Referential Integrity ensures that the values in the "DepartmentID" column of the "Employees" table correspond to valid DepartmentIDs in the "Departments" table.

> Explain what is meant by a transaction and why it is an important unit of operation in a DBMS?

Transaction is a sequence of one or more database operations that are treated as a single, indivisible unit of work. 

Here are some key characteristics of transactions and why they are important in a DBMS:

1. **Atomicity:** Transactions are atomic, meaning that they are treated as a single, all-or-nothing unit of work. Either all the operations within a transaction are completed successfully, or none of them are. 
    
2. **Consistency:** Transactions help maintain the consistency of the database. The database starts in a consistent state, and a transaction should leave it in a consistent state. 
    
3. **Isolation:** Transactions are isolated from each other to prevent interference between concurrent transactions. 
    
4. **Durability:** Once a transaction is successfully committed, its changes to the database are permanent and survive system failures.

> Write single sentence with a suitable example to illustrate the following relational concepts

- Candidate Key : A candidate key is a <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">set of one or more columns in a relational table that can uniquely identify each row</mark>; for example, in a "Students" table, both "StudentID" and "Email" can serve as candidate keys since they can uniquely identify students.
- Primary key: A primary key is a <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">specific candidate key chosen to be the main method of uniquely identifying rows</mark> in a table; for instance, in an "Orders" table, "OrderID" is the primary key, ensuring each order has a unique identifier.
- Composite key: A composite key is a <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">primary key that consists of two or more columns used together to uniquely identify rows;</mark>for instance, in an "Employees" table, a composite key might include both "EmployeeID" and "DepartmentID" to ensure uniqueness.
- Unique key: A unique key is a constraint that <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">enforces the uniqueness of values in one or more columns,</mark> similar to a candidate key, but it is not necessarily the chosen primary key; for example, in a "Books" table, "ISBN" can be a unique key to ensure each book has a unique ISBN.
- Atomic key: An atomic key is a key that consists of a <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">single column with indivisible, non-composite values</mark>, such as a "SocialSecurityNumber" in a "Citizens" table, ensuring each citizen's SSN is unique.

# Question 05
# Question 06

A major objective of the ANSI-SPARC architecture is to provide data independence.

> [!question]
> Using examples, discuss the concepts of logical data independence and physical data independence.

Logical data independence is a concept in database management that refers to the ability to <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">change the logical structure or schema of a database without affecting the application programs</mark> or user views that interact with the data.

Example: Let's consider a database for a library. The library has a database table called "Books" with columns like "Title," "Author," and "Publication Year." Application programs and user interfaces are designed to work with this structure.

Physical data independence is another concept in database management that pertains to the ability to <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">change the physical storage and access methods of data without affecting the logical structure</mark> or schema and the application programs that use the data.

Example: Continuing with our library database, suppose the library initially stores its data on a traditional hard disk drive (HDD).

> [!question]
> Describe four features (functions) you would expect to find in a DBMS

1. **Data Storage and Retrieval:**
    
    - **Data Storage:** A DBMS should provide a mechanism to efficiently <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">store and manage large volumes of data. </mark>
    - **Data Retrieval:** The DBMS should allow users to <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">retrieve data</mark> using SQL (Structured Query Language) queries. 
      
2. **Data Security and Access Control:**
    
    - **Authentication:** The DBMS should support user authentication to ensure that <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">only authorized users can access the database.</mark> 
    - **Authorization:** It should allow for access control mechanisms to <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">determine what actions (read, write, delete) users or roles are allowed to perform on specific data.</mark> 
    - **Encryption:** The DBMS may provide data encryption features to protect sensitive information stored in the database.
      
3. **Data Integrity and Constraints:**
    
    - **Data Integrity Constraints:** DBMS should support the definition and enforcement of data integrity constraints such as primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints, and check constraints.
    - **Referential Integrity:** It should enforce referential integrity to maintain relationships between tables and ensure that foreign keys reference valid primary keys.
    - **Transaction Management:** The DBMS should provide support for transactions, ensuring that database operations are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable (ACID properties), which helps maintain data integrity.
      
4. **Query Optimization and Performance Tuning:**
    
    - **Query Optimization:** A DBMS should include a query optimizer that analyzes SQL queries and determines the most efficient way to execute them.
    - **Indexing:** It should support indexing mechanisms to speed up data retrieval by creating efficient data structures for frequently queried columns.
    - **Caching:** Some DBMSs use caching to store frequently accessed data in memory, reducing the need to fetch data from disk, which can significantly improve response times.
