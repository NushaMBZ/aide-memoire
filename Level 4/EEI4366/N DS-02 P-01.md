# SQL

SQL, which stands for Structured Query Language, is a specialized programming language used for managing and manipulating relational databases.
## Command Categories

1. **DDL (Data Definition Language)**:
    
    - DDL commands are used to define and manage the structure or schema of a database.
    - These commands include operations such as creating, altering, and dropping database objects like tables, indexes, and views.
    - Common DDL commands include<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`.</mark>
2. **DML (Data Manipulation Language)**:
    
    - DML commands are used to manipulate the data stored within a database.
    - These commands include operations such as querying data, inserting new records, updating existing records, and deleting records.
    - Common DML commands include <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">`SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`.</mark>
3. **DCL (Data Control Language)**:
    
    - DCL commands are used to control access and permissions within a database. They manage the security and access rights of users and roles.
    - These commands include operations such as granting or revoking privileges on database objects.
    - Common DCL commands include <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">`GRANT` and `REVOKE`.</mark>

## Integrity

> [!tip]
> Constraints are rules used to limit the type of data that can go into a table.
> 

**Entity Integrity**:

Entity integrity is one of the fundamental principles of database design and is typically enforced using primary keys in SQL databases.

It ensures that <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">each row in a table is uniquely identifiable,</mark> and no two rows have the same primary key value.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Books (
    BookID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Title VARCHAR(255),
    Author VARCHAR(255),
    ISBN VARCHAR(13)
);
```

**Data Integrity:**

Data integrity ensures the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">accuracy and consistency of data</mark> within a single table. It's enforced through <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">constraints that define rules for the data in the table.</mark>

## Constraints

1. **Primary Key Constraint:**
   
   Example: Creating a `Students` table with a primary key constraint on the `StudentID` column to ensure each student has a unique identifier.

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE Students (
       StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
       FirstName VARCHAR(50),
       LastName VARCHAR(50)
   );
   ```

2. **Unique Constraint:**

   Example: Ensuring that email addresses in the `Users` table are unique.

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE Users (
       UserID INT PRIMARY KEY,
       Email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
       Password VARCHAR(50)
   );
   ```

3. **Check Constraint:**

   Example: Using a check constraint to ensure that ages in the `Employees` table are between 18 and 65.

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE Employees (
       EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
       FirstName VARCHAR(50),
       LastName VARCHAR(50),
       Age INT CHECK (Age >= 18 AND Age <= 65),
       Gender CHAR CHECK (Gender IN ('M','F'))
   );
   ```

**Referential Integrity:**

Referential integrity <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">ensures the consistency of relationships between tables.</mark> It's enforced using foreign key constraints and optionally specifying cascade actions.

1. **Foreign Key Constraint:**

   Example: Creating a `Orders` table with a foreign key constraint that references the `CustomerID` in the `Customers` table. This ensures that each order is associated with a valid customer.

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE Customers (
       CustomerID INT PRIMARY KEY,
       CustomerName VARCHAR(100)
   );

   CREATE TABLE Orders (
       OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,
       OrderDate DATE,
       CustomerID INT,
       FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customers(CustomerID)
   );
   ```

2. **Cascade Actions (CASCADE UPDATE):**

   Example: Specifying a CASCADE UPDATE action so that when a `CustomerID` is updated in the `Customers` table, the corresponding `CustomerID` in the `Orders` table is automatically updated.

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE Customers (
       CustomerID INT PRIMARY KEY,
       CustomerName VARCHAR(100)
   );

   CREATE TABLE Orders (
       OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,
       OrderDate DATE,
       CustomerID INT,
       FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customers(CustomerID) ON UPDATE CASCADE
   );
   ```

   If you update a customer's `CustomerID` in the `Customers` table, the change will automatically propagate to the `Orders` table.

3. **Cascade Actions (CASCADE DELETE):**

   Example: Specifying a CASCADE DELETE action so that when a customer is deleted from the `Customers` table, all related orders in the `Orders` table are also deleted.

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE Customers (
       CustomerID INT PRIMARY KEY,
       CustomerName VARCHAR(100)
   );

   CREATE TABLE Orders (
       OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,
       OrderDate DATE,
       CustomerID INT,
       FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customers(CustomerID) ON DELETE CASCADE
   );
   ```

   If you delete a customer, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">all of their associated orders will also be deleted automatically.</mark>


#### **HAVING**

The `HAVING` clause in MySQL is used to <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">filter the grouped rows based on a condition. </mark>

>[!example]
>You could use the `HAVING` clause to filter the grouped rows in a table of sales data to only include product categories with sales greater than $100,000. Or, you could use the `HAVING` clause to filter the grouped rows in a table of customer data to only include regions with more than 1,000 customers.

#### **ORDER BY**

The `ORDER BY` clause in MySQL is used <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">to sort the grouped rows in a specific order.</mark> 

> [!example]
> You could use the `ORDER BY` clause to sort the grouped rows in a table of sales data by sales volume, in descending order. This would show the product categories with the highest sales at the top of the table. Or, you could use the `ORDER BY` clause to sort the grouped rows in a table of customer data by region, in alphabetical order. This would show the regions in alphabetical order.

```mysql
SELECT product_name, COUNT(*) AS num_orders
FROM orders
GROUP BY product_name
HAVING num_orders > 10
ORDER BY num_orders DESC;
```


#### LIKE

The LIKE clause in MySQL is used to search for a specified pattern in a column. It can be used in conjunction with the WHERE clause to filter the rows that are returned by a query.

The LIKE clause uses two wildcards:

- **%** - Matches zero, one, or more characters.
- **\_** - Matches one character.

```mysql
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE last_name LIKE '%smith';
```

#### DISTINCT

  
The DISTINCT keyword in MySQL is used to return only unique values from a column or expression.

The DISTINCT keyword is especially useful for removing duplicate values from a table. For example, the following query will return all unique product names from the `products` table:

```MYSQL
SELECT DISTINCT product_name FROM products;
```
#### JOIN

JOIN operation is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. This operation allows you to retrieve data from multiple tables simultaneously, creating a virtual table or result set that combines information from the joined tables. 
![[Pasted image 20231009110451.png]]
There are several types of JOINs in SQL, including:

1. **INNER JOIN**: This is the most common type of JOIN. It returns only the rows <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">where there is a match in both tables based on the specified join condition.</mark> Rows from one table that do not have a matching row in the other table are excluded from the result.

   ```sql
   SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName
   FROM Orders
   INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID;
   ```

2. **LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN)**: This returns <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">all rows from the left (or first) table and the matched rows from the right</mark> (or second) table. If there is no match in the right table, NULL values are returned for the columns from the right table.

   ```sql
   SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID
   FROM Customers
   LEFT JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;
   ```

3. **RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN)**: This is similar to a LEFT JOIN but returns <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">all rows from the right (or second) table and the matched rows from the left (or first) table.</mark> Rows from the left table with no match in the right table result in NULL values for the columns from the left table.

   ```sql
   SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID
   FROM Customers
   RIGHT JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;
   ```

4. **FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN)**: This returns <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">all rows when there is a match in either the left or the right table.</mark> If there is no match in one of the tables, NULL values are returned for the columns from the table without a match.

   ```sql
   SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID
   FROM Customers
   FULL JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;
   ```

5. **CROSS JOIN**: This type of JOIN produces a <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Cartesian product of all rows from the first table and all rows from the second table.</mark> It is used when you want to combine every row from one table with every row from another table, resulting in a large result set.

   ```sql
   SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Products.ProductName
   FROM Customers
   CROSS JOIN Products;
   ```

6. **SELF JOIN**: This is a JOIN operation where a table is joined with itself. It is often used when dealing with hierarchical data or when you need to compare rows within the same table.

   ```sql
   SELECT e1.EmployeeName, e2.EmployeeName AS ManagerName
   FROM Employees e1
   LEFT JOIN Employees e2 ON e1.ManagerID = e2.EmployeeID;
   ```

## Aggregate Functions

Aggregate functions in MySQL are functions that perform a calculation on a set of values and return a single value.

Here are some of the most common aggregate functions in MySQL:

- **AVG()** - Returns the average of a set of values.

```mysql
SELECT customer_name, AVG(total_price) AS average_order_total
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_name;
```

- **COUNT()** - Returns the number of rows in a set of rows.

```mysql
SELECT AVG(total_price) AS average_order_total
FROM orders
WHERE customer_id IN (
  SELECT customer_id FROM orders
  GROUP BY customer_id
  HAVING COUNT(*) > 10
);
```

- **SUM()** - Returns the sum of a set of values.
- **MIN()** - Returns the smallest value in a set of values.
- **MAX()** - Returns the largest value in a set of values.

```mysql
-- Calculate the total sales for each product category:
SELECT category, SUM(sales) AS total_sales
FROM products
GROUP BY category;

-- Calculate the average number of employees per department:
SELECT department, AVG(employee_count) AS average_employee_count
FROM departments
GROUP BY department;

-- Calculate the minimum salary for each job title:
SELECT job_title, MIN(salary) AS minimum_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY job_title;

-- Calculate the maximum commission earned by each salesperson:
SELECT salesperson, MAX(commission) AS maximum_commission
FROM orders
GROUP BY salesperson;
```

## Sub-queries

Sub-queries in MySQL are queries that are nested inside of other queries. They can be used to filter the results of a query, to perform complex calculations, or to join multiple tables together.

**Filter the results of a query**

The following query uses a subquery to filter the results of the main query:

```mysql
SELECT * FROM products
WHERE price > (SELECT AVG(price) FROM products);
```

**Perform complex calculations**

The following query uses a subquery to perform a complex calculation:

```mysql
SELECT customer_name, SUM(total_price) AS total_orders
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_name
HAVING SUM(total_price) > (SELECT SUM(total_price) / 10 FROM orders);
```

**Join multiple tables together**

The following query uses a subquery to join multiple tables together:

```mysql
SELECT customer_name, product_name, SUM(quantity) AS quantity_ordered
FROM orders
INNER JOIN (
  SELECT customer_id, product_id, QUANTITY
  FROM order_items
) AS order_items ON orders.id = order_items.customer_id
GROUP BY customer_name, product_name
ORDER BY quantity_ordered DESC;
```
