```

**Using Numeric Indices**

Indices in R are 1-based, meaning the first element has an index of 1.

```r
# Create a vector
my_vector <- c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50)

# Access individual elements by index
element_1 <- my_vector[1]  # 10
element_3 <- my_vector[3]  # 30
```

**Using a Sequence of Indices**
```r
# Extract a subset of elements
subset_vector <- my_vector[c(2, 4)]  # 20, 40
```

**Using Logical Indices (Subsetting with Conditions)**
```r
# Create a logical condition
condition <- my_vector > 25

# Subset based on the condition
subset_condition <- my_vector[condition]  # 30, 40, 50
```

**Using Negative Indices**
```r
# Exclude the first and third elements
excluded_elements <- my_vector[-c(1, 3)]  # 20, 40, 50
```

**Vectorized Logical Indexing**
```r
# Create a logical vector
logical_indices <- c(FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)

# Subset based on logical indices
subset_logical <- my_vector[logical_indices]  # 20, 30, 50
```

### Matrices 
Rectangular array of numbers, symbols and expressions.

The basic syntax for creating a matrix in R:   
```r
matrix(data, nrow, ncol, byrow, dimnames)  
```

Where, 
- `data`: input vector which becomes the data elements of the matrix. 
- `nrow`: number of rows to be created. 
- `ncol`: number of columns to be created. â€¢ 
- `byrow`: a logical clue. If TRUE then the input vector elements  are arranged by row. 
- `dimnames`: list of names assigned to the rows and columns. 

#### Matrix calculations
- Addition 
	- Element by element addition   A+B 
- Subtraction 
	- Element by element subtraction    A-B 
- Multiplication 
	- Element by element multiplication A\*B 
- Matrix multiplication   
	- If A and B are two matrices   A%*%B 
- Division 
	- Element by element division   A/B 


#### Matrix computations 
- `t()`  To get the transpose of a matrix  
- `rankMatrix()`  To get the rank of a matrix   
- `sum(diag())`  To get the trace of a matrix
- `det(A)`  To get the determinant of a matrix 
- `solve(A)`  To get the inverse of a matrix A 

### Arrays 
Arrays are the R data objects which can store data in more than  two dimensions.

The basic syntax for creating a array in R:   
```r
array(data, dim, dimnames) 
```

Where, 
- `data`: input vector which becomes the data elements of the  matrix. 
- `dim`: integer vector iving the number of indices of each  dimension 
- `dimnames`: list of names assigned to the dimensions. 

```r
array(c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8),dim=c(2,4))        
	  [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] 
[1,]    1    3    5    7 
[2,]    2    4    6    8 
```

**Input**
```r
vector1<-c(1,2,3) 
vector2<-c(4,5,6,7,8) 
colNames<-c("Col1","Col2","Col3","Col4") 
rowNames<-c("Row1","Row2") 
matrixNames<-c("Mat1","Mat2") 
arr1<-array(c(vector1,vector2), dim = c(2,4,2), dimnames = list(rowNames,colNames,matrixNames)) 
```
**Output**
```r
, , Mat1

     Col1 Col2 Col3 Col4
Row1    1    3    5    7
Row2    2    4    6    8

, , Mat2

     Col1 Col2 Col3 Col4
Row1    1    3    5    7
Row2    2    4    6    8
```

**Using Numeric Indices**
```r
# Create a 2x3x3 array
my_array <- array(1:18, dim = c(2, 3, 3))

# Access individual elements by indices
element <- my_array[1, 2, 3]  # Access element at (1, 2, 3)
```

**Using Sequences of Indices**
```r
# Extract a subset of elements
subset_array <- my_array[1:2, , 2]  # Extract rows 1 and 2, all columns, and layer 2
```

**Using Logical Indices**
```r
# Create logical conditions for each dimension
condition_1 <- c(TRUE, FALSE)
condition_2 <- matrix(c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE), nrow = 2)
condition_3 <- c(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)

# Subset based on logical conditions
subset_logical <- my_array[condition_1, condition_2, condition_3]
```

**Using Negative Indices**
```r
# Exclude the first row, second column, and third layer
excluded_elements <- my_array[-1, ,-3]
```

**Array Slicing**
```r
# Slice the array
sliced_array <- my_array[1:2, 2:3, 1:2]

```

**Vectorized Logical Indexing**
```r
# Create logical matrices
logical_indices_1 <- matrix(c(TRUE, FALSE), nrow = 1)
logical_indices_2 <- matrix(c(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE), nrow = 1)
logical_indices_3 <- matrix(c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE), nrow = 1)

# Subset based on logical indices
subset_logical_array <- my_array[logical_indices_1, logical_indices_2, logical_indices_3]
```

### Lists 
In R, a list is a versatile data structure that can contain elements of different data types, such as vectors, matrices, data frames, other lists, or even functions.

```r
my_list <- list(name = "John", age = 30, scores = c(85, 92, 78))
```
#### Accessing Elements
```r
# Accessing elements by name
name <- my_list$name
age <- my_list$age
scores <- my_list$scores

# Accessing elements by position
first_element <- my_list[[1]]
second_element <- my_list[[2]]

```
#### Adding Element
```r
# Adding a new element
my_list$new_element <- "Some value"

# Adding an element using indexing
my_list[[4]] <- "Another value"
```
#### Nested Lists
```r
# Creating a nested list
nested_list <- list(
  person = list(name = "Alice", age = 25),
  scores = c(90, 88, 95)
)
```

#### List Operations:

You can perform various operations on lists:

- **Length:** Get the number of elements in a list with `length(my_list)`.
    
- **Names:** Get the names of elements in a list with `names(my_list)`.
    
- **Subsetting:** Extract a subset of a list using indexing or subsetting operations.
    
- **Removing Elements:** Use the `NULL` value to remove elements from a list.
    
- **Iterating:** Loop through elements in a list using functions like `lapply()` and `sapply()`.

```r
# Removing an element
my_list$age <- NULL

# Iterating through a list
lapply(my_list, function(x) print(x))
```

### Data Frames

In R, a data frame is a two-dimensional tabular data structure that can hold data of different types, similar to a spreadsheet or a database table. Data frames are a fundamental data structure for data manipulation and analysis in R, and they are commonly used to store and work with structured data.

Here are the key features and characteristics of data frames in R:

1. **Tabular Structure:** Data frames have rows and columns, similar to a table in a relational database or a spreadsheet. Each row represents a single observation or record, while each column represents a variable or attribute.
    
2. **Heterogeneous Data:** A data frame can hold different types of data, such as numeric values, character strings, factors, dates, and more, in its various columns.
    
3. **Column Names:** Columns in a data frame have names, which can be used to refer to specific variables. These names are also used when accessing and manipulating the data.
    
4. **Observations:** Each row in a data frame represents an observation, case, or record. This could be anything from a person's information to a data point in an experiment.
    
5. **Data Manipulation:** R provides numerous functions and packages for data manipulation, transformation, filtering, and aggregation on data frames. The "dplyr" package is a commonly used tool for such operations.
    
6. **Data Analysis:** Data frames are the foundation for statistical analysis in R. You can apply statistical functions, perform hypothesis tests, and create visualizations based on the data stored in data frames.
    
7. **Importing and Exporting Data:** R supports various formats for importing and exporting data frames, including CSV, Excel, SQL databases, and more. This makes it easy to work with data from different sources.
    
8. **Indexing and Subsetting:** You can access specific rows and columns in a data frame using indexing, column names, or logical conditions.

```r
# Creating a data frame
my_df <- data.frame(
  Name = c("Alice", "Bob", "Carol"),
  Age = c(25, 30, 28),
  Score = c(90, 85, 92)
)

# Printing the data frame
print(my_df)

# Accessing specific columns
names <- my_df$Name
ages <- my_df$Age

# Adding a new column
my_df$Grade <- c("A", "B", "A")

# Subsetting rows based on a condition
subset_df <- my_df[my_df$Age > 25, ]
```

>The `fix()` function is used to open a data object, such as a data frame or a matrix, in an interactive spreadsheet-like editor.

### Regular sequences 

#### seq()
In R, a regular sequence is a sequence of numbers that follow a consistent pattern with a defined start, end, and interval.

The `seq()` and `seq.int()` functions are often used to create regular sequences in R:

1. **Using `seq()` Function:**

	The `seq()` function generates a sequence of numbers with a specified start, end, and interval.

```r
# Generate a sequence from 1 to 10 with an interval of 1
sequence_1 <- seq(from = 1, to = 10, by = 1)
print(sequence_1)

# Generate a sequence from 0 to 1 with 0.2 interval
sequence_2 <- seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = 0.2)
print(sequence_2)
```

2. **Using `seq.int()` Function:**

	The `seq.int()` function generates a sequence of integers with a specified start, end, and interval.
	
```r
# Generate a sequence of integers from 5 to 20 with an interval of 3
int_sequence <- seq.int(from = 5, to = 20, by = 3)
print(int_sequence)
```

3. **Shortcut Notation:**

	R also supports a shorter notation for generating regular sequences using the colon `:` operator. This is commonly used when creating sequences with an interval of 1.

```r
# Generate a sequence from 1 to 5 using the colon operator
short_sequence <- 1:5
print(short_sequence)
```

Regular sequences can be used in various contexts, including:

- **Loop Iteration:** When you want to repeat a process a specific number of times or iterate through a sequence of indices.
    
- **Generating Data Points:** When you need a set of data points for plotting graphs or generating data for simulations.
    
- **Vector Indexing:** To access specific elements in a vector using a sequence of indices.
    
- **Time Series Generation:** When working with time series data, you might generate regular sequences of dates or timestamps.


#### rep()

The `rep()` function is used to replicate or repeat values, vectors, or other objects a specified number of times.

The basic syntax of the `rep()` function is as follows:
```r
rep(x, times, each)

```

- `x`: The object or value you want to replicate.
- `times`: The number of times you want to replicate the entire object.
- `each`: The number of times you want to replicate each element within the object. This argument is optional.

```r
# Replicating a single value
repeated_value <- rep(5, times = 3)
print(repeated_value)  
# Outputs: 5 5 5

# Replicating a vector
original_vector <- c(1, 2, 3)
repeated_vector <- rep(original_vector, times = 2)
print(repeated_vector)  
# Outputs: 1 2 3 1 2 3

# Replicating each element in a vector
repeated_each <- rep(original_vector, each = 2)
print(repeated_each)  
# Outputs: 1 1 2 2 3 3

# Replicating a matrix
original_matrix <- matrix(1:6, nrow = 2)
repeated_matrix <- rep(original_matrix, times = 2)
print(repeated_matrix)
# Outputs:
#      [,1] [,2]
# [1,]    1    3
# [2,]    2    4
# [3,]    1    3
# [4,]    2    4

# Replicating using both 'times' and 'each'
repeated_both <- rep(original_vector, times = 2, each = 2)
print(repeated_both)  
# Outputs: 1 1 2 2 3 3 1 1 2 2 3 3
```
