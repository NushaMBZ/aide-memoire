# Data
Any <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">collection of information, facts</mark>, or statistics that can be recorded, measured, or represented in a structured form. 

> It can be raw and unprocessed, or it can be organized and processed to extract meaningful insights.

## Categories of Data
Data can be categorized into various types based on their nature, characteristics, and the way they are represented.

1. **<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Numerical Data</mark>:**
    - **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Continuous Data</mark>**: Represents <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">measurable quantities that can take any value within a certain range.</mark> Examples include height, weight, temperature.
    - **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Discrete Data</mark>**: Represents <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">distinct, separate values.</mark> Examples include the number of people in a room, the count of items sold.
2. **<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Categorical Data</mark>:**
    - **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Nominal Data</mark>**: Represents <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">categories without any inherent order.</mark> Examples include colors, gender, types of fruits.
    - **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Ordinal Data</mark>**: Represents <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">categories with a meaningful order</mark> or ranking. Examples include education levels (e.g., high school, bachelor's, master's).

# Measurement
Measurement refers to <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">the process of assigning a numerical value to a particular attribute</mark> or characteristic of an object, event, phenomenon, or individual.

> The goal of measurement is to quantify or represent the property being measured in a standardized and systematic manner.

Measurement in general has two distinct parts:

**<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">The True Score</mark>:**
- The "True Score" refers to <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">the actual, accurate, and objective value</mark> of the attribute or characteristic you are trying to measure.
**<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Error</mark>:**
- "Error" in this context refers to the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">discrepancy or deviation between the true score and the measured value.</mark>

# Population and Sample

## Population
The population refers to <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">the entire group of individuals, objects, or items that possess a certain characteristic or feature of interest</mark> in a particular study.

## Sample
A sample is a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">subset or smaller representative group taken from the larger population.</mark>

# Descriptive statistics

This is a branch of statistics that <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">involves organizing, summarizing, and presenting data in a meaningful and informative way.
</mark>
Descriptive statistics includes various measures and techniques, such as:

1. **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Measures of Central Tendency</mark>**: These include the mean (average), median (middle value), and mode (most frequent value) of a dataset.
2. **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Measures of Dispersion</mark>**: These measures, such as the range, variance, and standard deviation, describe how spread out the data points are from the center. 
3. **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Frequency Distributions</mark>**: These involve creating tables or graphs that show the frequency or count of each distinct value or range of values in a dataset. 
4. **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Percentiles and Quartiles</mark>**: These divide the data into percentiles (such as the median, which is the 50th percentile) or quartiles (which divide the data into four equal parts).
5. **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Skewness and Kurtosis</mark>**: Skewness measures the asymmetry of the data distribution, while kurtosis measures the peakedness or flatness of the distribution.
6. **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Graphical Representations</mark>**: Visual tools like scatter plots, bar charts, pie charts, and box plots help illustrate the distribution and patterns in the data.
7. **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Measures of Relationships</mark>**: Correlation coefficients indicate the strength and direction of linear relationships between pairs of variables.

# Variable
Variable is a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">characteristic, attribute, or quantity that can take on different values.</mark>

1. **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Categorical Variables</mark>**: Also known as qualitative variables, these <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">represent categories or groups that do not have a natural numerical ordering.</mark>
2. **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Ordinal Variables</mark>**: These variables have <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">categories with a natural order</mark>, but the differences between categories might not be consistent or meaningful. 
3. **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Numerical Variables</mark>** (Quantitative Variables): These variables represent <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">quantities that can be measured and have meaningful numerical values.</mark> They can be further classified into:
    - **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Discrete Variables</mark>**: These variables <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">can only take on specific, distinct values within a certain range.</mark> 
    - **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Continuous Variables</mark>**: These variables can<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;"> take on any value within a certain range, often involving measurement.</mark>

3. **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Quantiles and Percentiles</mark>**: These provide insights into the distribution and help <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">identify potential outliers</mark>:
    - **Quartiles**: Values that divide the data into four equal parts (25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles).
    - **Percentiles**: Values that divide the data into hundred equal parts (e.g., 90th percentile).
4. **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Skewness and Kurtosis</mark>**: These indicate the <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">shape of the distribution</mark>:
    - **Skewness**: Measures the asymmetry of the distribution.
    - **Kurtosis**: Measures the peakedness or flatness of the distribution compared to a normal distribution.
5. **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Visualizations</mark>**: Histograms, box plots, density plots, and other graphical representations provide visual insights into the distribution of the variable.

# Data Visualization
Data visualization refers to <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">the representation of data and information through visual elements</mark> such as charts, graphs, maps, and other graphical formats.

1. **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Univariate Visualization</mark>**: Univariate visualization involves <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">examining a single variable in isolation.</mark>  Common types of univariate visualizations include:
    
    - **<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Histograms</mark>**: Display the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">frequency distribution of a single numerical variable by dividing it into bins and showing the frequency of observations in each bin.</mark>
    - **<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Bar Charts</mark>**: Used for <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">categorical variables to show the frequency or proportion of each category.</mark>
    - **<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Box Plots</mark>**: Display the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">summary statistics (minimum, maximum, quartiles) of a numerical variable and help identify outliers.</mark>
    - **<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Density Plots</mark>**: Similar to histograms, these show <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">the distribution of a variable as a smoothed curve.</mark>
      
2. **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Bivariate Visualization</mark>**: Bivariate visualization involves <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">analyzing the relationship between two variables. </mark> Common types of bivariate visualizations include:

## Univariate Visualization
### Histogram

A histogram is a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">graphical representation of the distribution of a single numerical variable.</mark> It provides insights into the frequency or count of observations falling within different intervals or "bins" of the variable's range. Histograms are particularly useful for understanding the shape, central tendency, variability, and potential outliers in a dataset.

Here's how a histogram is typically constructed:

1. **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Data Binning</mark>**: The <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">range of the numerical variable is divided into several non-overlapping intervals or bins.</mark> 
    
2. **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Frequency Count</mark>**: The <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">number of observations falling into each bin is counted.</mark> This count represents the frequency of observations within that bin.
    
3. **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Vertical Bars</mark>**: The <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">bins are represented along the horizontal axis</mark>, and the frequency counts are represented along the vertical axis. 
    
4. **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Bar Width</mark>**: The <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">width of the bars is determined by the width of the bins.</mark> 
    
5. **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Visualization of Distribution</mark>**: The resulting histogram <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">displays the distribution of the numerical variable's data</mark>, showing the concentration of data points in different ranges. It can reveal characteristics such as symmetry, skewness, multimodality (multiple peaks), and the presence of outliers.
![[Pasted image 20231102131556.png]]
#### Key Features 

- **Shape**: The overall shape of the histogram can resemble various patterns, such as bell-shaped (normal distribution), skewed (asymmetric), or uniform.
- **Central Tendency**: The central tendency of the data, including the mode (peak) of the distribution, can be identified.
- **Spread and Dispersion**: The spread of data across the range of values is depicted, and the variability can be observed.
- **Outliers**: Extreme values that are significantly different from the rest of the data might appear as isolated bars or regions outside the main distribution.

### Box Plots
A box plot, also known as a box-and-whisker plot, is a graphical representation that displays <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">the summary statistics and distribution of a numerical dataset.</mark> It provides a visual summary of the minimum, first quartile (Q1), median (second quartile or Q2), third quartile (Q3), and maximum values of the data, along with information about potential outliers.

Here's how a box plot is typically constructed:

1. **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Minimum and Maximum</mark>**: A line is <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">drawn from the minimum value to the maximum value of the dataset</mark>, forming the "whiskers" of the plot.
    
2. **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Interquartile Range (IQR)</mark>**: The <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">range between the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3)</mark> is calculated. This range, IQR = Q3 - Q1, represents the middle 50% of the data.
    
3. **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Median Line</mark>**: A <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">vertical line or a box is drawn at the median (Q2) of the data.</mark> The median is the value that divides the data into two halves, with half of the observations falling below it and half above it.
    
4. **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Box</mark>**: A <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">box is drawn between Q1 and Q3</mark>, enclosing the IQR. This box visually represents the spread of the middle 50% of the data.
    
5. **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Whiskers</mark>**: The <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">whiskers extend from the box to the minimum and maximum values within a defined range (often 1.5 times the IQR).</mark> Observations beyond this range are considered potential outliers and are displayed as individual data points.
    
6. **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Outliers</mark>**: <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Individual data points that fall outside the whiskers are typically marked as points or dots on the plot</mark>, representing potential outliers.

![[Pasted image 20231102131645.png]]

Box plots provide several insights into the data:

- **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Central Tendency</mark>**: The median is a measure of central tendency, <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">indicating where the middle value lies.</mark>
- **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Spread and Variability</mark>**: The IQR provides <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">information about the spread or dispersion of the middle 50% of the data.</mark>
- **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Skewness</mark>**: The length of the whiskers and the positioning of the median within the box can <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">suggest the skewness of the distribution.</mark>
- **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Outliers</mark>**: Outliers are<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;"> easily identifiable as points outside the whiskers.</mark>

### Transparent plotting

Transparent plotting, also known as <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">alpha blending or opacity, is a visualization technique used in data plotting and graphing to represent overlapping data points</mark> or multiple layers of information. 

## Bivariate Visualization
### Stacked Bar  Chart
A stacked bar chart is a type of data visualization that <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">presents categorical data using horizontal or vertical bars.</mark> In a stacked bar chart, the bars are divided into segments or "stacks," each representing a different subcategory or component of the data. The total height (or width) of each bar represents the cumulative value of the subcategories it comprises.

Here's how a stacked bar chart is typically constructed:

1. **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Axis and Bars</mark>**: <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">The categorical variable (e.g., different time periods, regions, products) is represented on one axis (usually the horizontal axis) while the values are represented on the other axis</mark> (usually the vertical axis).
    
2. **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Stacks</mark>**: Each <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">bar is divided into segments or stacks, where each stack represents a subcategory.</mark> Each subcategory's value is shown as the height (or width) of its corresponding stack.
    
3. **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Colors</mark>**: Different colors are often used to <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">differentiate the subcategories within each bar.</mark> The color segments help viewers identify which part of the bar corresponds to which subcategory.
    
4. **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Total Bar Height</mark>**: <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">The cumulative height (or width) of the stacks in a bar represents the total value for the category being visualized.</mark> This makes it easy to compare the relative sizes of the categories as well as the proportions of the subcategories.

![[Pasted image 20231102132237.png]]
## Multivariate Visualization
### Pairwise Scatterplots
Often referred to as a scatterplot matrix or pair plot, are a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">form of data visualization that allows you to examine the relationships between multiple pairs of numerical variables in a single display.</mark>


# Statistical Distributions
Statistical distributions, also known as <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">probability distributions, describe the possible outcomes and their associated probabilities for a given random variable.</mark>

Here are some common types of statistical distributions:

1. **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Normal Distribution (Gaussian Distribution)</mark>**: The normal distribution is one of the most well-known distributions and is<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;"> characterized by its bell-shaped curve.</mark> Many natural processes tend to follow a normal distribution, with data clustering around the mean and symmetrical tails. Parameters include the mean (μ) and the standard deviation (σ).
    
2. **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Uniform Distribution</mark>**: The uniform distribution has <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">a constant probability for all values within a specified range.</mark> It's often used when all outcomes are equally likely.
    
3. **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Exponential Distribution</mark>**: The exponential distribution describes the <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">time between events in a process where events occur continuously and independently at a constant average rate.</mark> It's often used in survival analysis and queuing theory.
    
4. **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Poisson Distribution</mark>**: The Poisson distribution <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">models the number of events that occur in a fixed interval of time or space</mark>, given a known average rate. It's commonly used for rare events or counting occurrences.
    
5. **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Binomial Distribution</mark>**: The binomial distribution <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials </mark>(experiments with two possible outcomes). It's used for situations like coin flips or success/failure experiments.
    
6. **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Geometric Distribution</mark>**: The geometric distribution <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">models the number of trials needed for the first success in a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials.</mark>
    
7. **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Gamma Distribution</mark>**: The gamma distribution is a <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">versatile distribution that extends the exponential and chi-squared distributions.</mark> It's often used to model waiting times or survival times.
    
8. **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Beta Distribution</mark>**: The beta distribution is commonly used to<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;"> model continuous random variables that are bounded within a specific range.</mark> It's often used in Bayesian statistics.
    
9. **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Log-Normal Distribution</mark>**: The log-normal distribution is used for <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">variables that are the result of exponential growth, where the logarithm of the variable follows a normal distribution.</mark>


# Standard Deviation

The standard deviation is a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">measure of the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of data points.</mark> It quantifies how spread out the values in a dataset are around the mean (average) value.

$$
\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \mu)^2}
$$

The standard deviation has several important properties:

1. **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Dispersion</mark>**: A higher standard deviation <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">indicates greater variability or dispersion in the data points</mark>, while a lower standard deviation indicates less variability and more clustering around the mean.
    
2. **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Normal Distribution</mark>**: In a normal distribution, <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">about 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean, approximately 95% falls within two standard deviations, and around 99.7% falls within three standard deviations.</mark>
    
3. **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Outliers</mark>**: Extremely <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">high or low values (outliers) can significantly impact the standard deviation</mark>, making it sensitive to extreme observations.
    
4. **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Comparing Data Sets</mark>**: Standard deviation is commonly used to<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;"> compare the spread of data between different datasets or groups.</mark>
    
5. **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Variability</mark>**: A <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">small standard deviation suggests that the data values are close to the mean, while a large standard deviation suggests greater variability and larger differences from the mean.</mark>

## Standardized Scores
Also known as z-scores, are a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">way to measure how many standard deviations a data point is away from the mean of a dataset.</mark>

$$
z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}

$$
Interpreting standardized scores:

1. **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Centering</mark>**: If $Z$=0, it means the <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">data point is exactly at the mean of the distribution.</mark>
2. **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Direction</mark>**: <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Positive z-scores indicate that the data point is above the mean, while negative z-scores indicate that it is below the mean.</mark>
3. **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Magnitude</mark>**: The magnitude of the z-score indicates <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">how many standard deviations the data point is away from the mean.</mark> A z-score of 1 means the data point is 1 standard deviation away from the mean; a z-score of 2 means it's 2 standard deviations away, and so on.

Key uses of standardized scores:

- **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Comparison</mark>**: Z-scores allow you to <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">compare data points from different distributions or variables on a common scale</mark>, regardless of their original units.
- **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Outliers</mark>**: Z-scores can <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">help identify outliers as data points with z-scores significantly higher or lower than the mean.</mark>
- **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Normal Distribution</mark>**: In a normal distribution, you can <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">interpret z-scores as percentiles.</mark> For example, a z-score of 1 corresponds roughly to the 84th percentile.

## Standardized Normal Distribution

The standardized normal distribution, also known as the standard normal distribution or the Z-distribution, is <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">a specific type of normal distribution with a mean (μ) of 0 and a standard deviation (σ) of 1.</mark>

$$
f(z) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \cdot e^{-\frac{z^2}{2}}
$$
