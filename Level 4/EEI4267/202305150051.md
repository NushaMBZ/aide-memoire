## Architecture Business Cycle
![[Pasted image 20230520212251.png|400]]
A concept used in software development to describe the <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">iterative and continuous process of improving the software architecture over time.</mark>

**Needs**
Needs are the ==essential or basic requirements for survival and well-being.==

**Wants**
Wants are desires or ==preferences that go beyond basic needs.==

## Software Requirements
Software requirements are a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">set of documented functionalities, constraints, and qualities that a software system must possess or exhibit.</mark>

## Objectives of Requirements
- **Specific**
	- The requirement should be clear about what the user needs
- **Measurable**
	- The business analyst should be able to quantify the progress of the requirement  
- **Achievable** 
	- Non-Stakeholder based requirement sources
- **Relevant**
	- Align the objective with the overall project or organizational goals.
- **Timely**
	- Set a specific time-frame or deadline for achieving the objective.

# Types of Requirements
## Business Requirements
These are <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">high-level statements that describe the goals, objectives, and needs of the organization or business.</mark>
>the business strategy of the business organization, along with its long-term and short-term business plans.
### Challenges

- Strategic level business changes
- Market analysis-based business changes
- External changes that demand the business to change
## User Requirements
These are <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">high-level statements that describe the goals, objectives, and needs of the organization or business.</mark>
### A good user requirement might be 
- Verifiable

- They may <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">convey their requirements in their own terminologies</mark>
- There may be a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">gap between what the user expects and what has been delivered</mark>
- Requirements may be <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">less specific</mark>
## System Requirements
The <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">technical aspect</mark> of the project that defines the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">requirements associated with the system being developed.</mark>
### Challenges
- Maintain the accuracy of the stated requirements.
- Preserving the completeness, consistency and avoiding any ambiguity within each requirement statements.
## Product Requirements
Product requirements define the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">specific features, functionalities, and characteristics that the product should have.</mark>
> Product requirments belong to the common type of non-functional requirments.
## Project / Organizational Requirments
Requirments related to the way we develop softwares and process activities followed throughout the lifecycle period.
## Internal Requirements
Any <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">requirments within the scope of development team or client of the projec</mark>t can be considered as IR.
## External Requirements
Anything <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">beyonf the scope of dev team or client</mark> is regarded as ER.
## Functional Requirements
User's <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">expected behaviour and functionalities</mark> of a system.
>Product features or functions that the software solution must implement to provide the user requested tasks achievement.
## Non-Functional Requirments
NFR specifies <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">how the system should work by considering the quality attrbutes.</mark>
## Domain Requirments
This type requirement outlines the s<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">tandards and regulations that needs to be complied for developing application.</mark>
> Functional requirments deal with the questions like what the system should do while Non Functional requirments deal with the question of How the system should behave

## Categories of Requirement
- Mutable Requirements : 
	- This type of requirement change <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">occur due to the changes to the environment which the system is operating</mark>
- Consequential Requirements : 
	- Consequential requirements are requirements that <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">emerge as a result of other predefined or existing requirements.</mark>
- Compatibility Requirements : 
	- These changes come due to the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">support issues arise with respect to the other factors/external entities of the system environment.</mark>
- Emergent Requirements : 
	- New or changed requirements that arise <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">during the course of a project or system development, typically as a result of evolving business needs, user feedback, technological advancements</mark>, or external factors.


# The Software Change Management Process
- Change Request
- Impact Assessment
- Change Evaluation and Decision
- Change Implementation
- Review and Reporting

![[Introduction-2.png|500]]

# Categories of Requirement Change
1. Mutable Requirements: Mutable requirements are those that are <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">subject to change during the course of a project.</mark> An example of a mutable requirement could be:  
	1. Original requirement: "The system should allow users to log in using a username and password."
	2. Mutable requirement change: "The system should allow users to log in using a username and password or using their social media accounts (e.g., Google, Facebook)."  
  
2. Consequential Requirements: Consequential requirements are <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">changes that arise as a result of other requirement changes</mark>. Here's an example:
	1. Original requirement: "The e-commerce website should have a shopping cart feature."
	2. Consequential requirement change: "The shopping cart feature should support both guest users and registered users. Guest users should be able to proceed to checkout without creating an account, while registered users can save their cart for future sessions."  
  
3. Compatibility Requirements: Compatibility requirements refer to changes necessary to ensure <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">compatibility with other systems or platforms.</mark> Here's an example:  
	1. Original requirement: "The mobile app should support Android devices."  
	2. Compatibility requirement change: "The mobile app should support both Android and iOS devices to reach a wider user base."  
  
4. Emergent Requirements: Emergent requirements are those that arise <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">unexpectedly during the development process.</mark> An example of an emergent requirement could be:  
	1. Original requirement: "The system should allow users to search for products by category."
	2. Emergent requirement: "Based on user feedback, the search functionality should also include a filter for price range and customer ratings."
## Effective ways to manage requirements
- Clear Documentation
- Stakeholder Collaboration
- Requirement Prioritization
- Change Control
- Traceability


# Requirement Traceability
The ability to <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">trace and establish relationships between different requirements</mark> throughout the development life-cycle.
```
<<source>><--><<requirement>><---><<Design descision>>
```
## Categories of Relationships
- **Backward-from Traceability**: This type establishes links from <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">requirements to their sources or stakeholders.</mark>
- **Forward-from Traceability**: This type establishes links from <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">requirements to their corresponding design and implementation artifacts</mark>(requirments).
- **Backward-to Traceability**: This type establishes links from <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">design and implementation artifacts back to the sourcing requirements</mark>.
- **Forward-to Traceability**: This type establishes links from <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">requirements to their downstream artifacts, such as test cases, user documentation, or other related artifacts.</mark>

## Requirement Traceability Matrix
