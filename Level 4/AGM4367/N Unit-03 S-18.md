> #/Q 

It is typically measured as the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">percentage change in the real gross domestic product (GDP) from one period to the next</mark>. Real GDP is the total value of all goods and services produced in an economy, adjusted for inflation.

## Determinants

> [!definition]
> #Q
> The factors that influence the rate at which an economy's output of goods and services increases over time.
> #/Q

#Q #AOSR/5q42k
- Natural resources :: The availability of natural resources, such as land, minerals, and water, can play a significant role in economic growth.  #AOSR/5q42k/s/2ltd
#/Q

#Q #AOSR/9g5gg
- Human resources :: The quality and quantity of the labor force is another important determinant of economic growth. #AOSR/9g5gg/s/i5v1
#/Q

#Q #AOSR/2j18j
- Physical capital :: Physical capital refers to the infrastructure and machinery that are used to produce goods and services.  #AOSR/2j18j/s/78k7
#/Q

#Q #AOSR/7sqm9
- Technology :: Technology is the knowledge and skills that are used to produce goods and services.  #AOSR/7sqm9/s/37sn
#/Q

## Theories

#Q #AOSR/2b8ve
- Classical growth theory :: This theory focuses on the role of <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">capital accumulation and technological progress in driving economic growth.</mark> #AOSR/2b8ve/s/5m1r
#/Q 

#Q  #AOSR/7f3uc
- Neoclassical growth theory:: This theory builds on classical growth theory by incorporating the role of <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">human capital in economic growth.</mark> #AOSR/7f3uc/s/3ndf
#/Q 

#Q  #AOSR/4fd55
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Endogenous growth theory::</mark> In this context economic growth is driven by <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">endogenous factors, such as technological innovation and human capital accumulation.</mark> #AOSR/4fd55/s/7smi
#/Q 
## Technology

> [!definition]
> #Q 
> Technology :: is defined as the knowledge and skills used to produce goods and services.
> #/Q 

An economy stagnates when it attempts to achieve economic growth solely through capital accumulation. It faces diminishing marginal returns for capital. Technological innovations shift the production possibility frontier outward through increased capital productivity.

### Growth Accounting
#Q #AOSR/1tkj0
Growth accounting :: is a q<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">uantitative method used to decompose economic growth into the contributions of different factors</mark>, such as labor, capital, and technology. #AOSR/1tkj0/s/1mki
$$
Q = AF (K, L, R) 
$$
Q  - Growth in output 
L  - Growth in labour * weight 
K  - Growth in capital * weight 
TC - technological change 
R  - Lands (resources) are a constant
#/Q 
```
% Q growth = ¾ (% L growth) + ¼ (% K growth) + T.C
```
## Strategies of economic development

#Q #AOSR/7msb3
- The Backwardness Hypothesis :: It explains the ability of developing countries to adopt new technologies developed in the rich countries. #AOSR/7msb3/s/3jkv
#/Q

#Q #AOSR/3imif
- Promoting a market economy :: Government should facilitate the functioning of market mechanism with less restrictions and allowing competition.  #AOSR/3imif/s/6j9d
#/Q

#Q #AOSR/7vt0v
- Outward orientation of economies :: This is a country’s consideration on international trade. #AOSR/7vt0v/s/ujko
