# Market and Government Policies

## Controls on Prices
#Q 
Control on prices :: It is a <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">government intervention in the market to regulate the price of goods and services.</mark> This can be done by setting a maximum price (price ceiling) or a minimum price (price floor).
#/Q 

### Price Ceiling
#Q 
A **price ceiling** :: It is a <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">legal maximum price that can be charged for a good or service.</mark> 
#/Q 
![[Pasted image 20231017113856.png]]
#Q
The effects of a price ceiling can be summarized as follows ::
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Shortages</mark>: A <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">price ceiling below the equilibrium price will create a shortage</mark> of the good or service. 
- **<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Black markets</mark>: A price ceiling can create a black market, where goods are sold <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">illegally at a higher price than the ceiling.</mark> 
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Reduced quality</mark>: Suppliers may <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">reduce the quality of the goods or services they sell in order to maintain profits.</mark> 
- **<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Inefficiency</mark>: A price ceiling can lead to inefficiency in the market. 
#/Q 

#Q 
>A <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">binding price ceiling</mark> :: It is a price ceiling that is <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">set below the equilibrium price.</mark> 

#/Q 

#Q 

> A <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">non-binding price ceiling</mark> :: It is a price ceiling that is s<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">et above the equilibrium price.</mark> 

#/Q

**Welfare effect of a price ceiling**: 
#Q
The welfare effect of a price ceiling :: It is a measure of the economic efficiency of a price ceiling. It is calculated by <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">comparing the total surplus in the market with and without the price ceiling.</mark>


The <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">welfare effect of a price ceiling is negative</mark>, as it leads to a decrease in total surplus. The decrease in total surplus is the result of the decrease in consumer surplus, which is larger than the decrease in producer surplus.
#/Q

### Price Floor
![[Pasted image 20231017120549.png]]
#Q
A **price floor** :: It is a <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">legal minimum price that can be paid for a good or service.</mark> It is imposed by the government to protect producers from receiving too low a price.
#/Q 

 However, it can also lead to surpluses, as suppliers are not able to sell all of their goods or services at the artificially high price.

#Q 
Welfare effects of price floor :: 
- **Surplus of Supply:** One of the most common effects of a price floor is the creation of a surplus of supply.
- **Reduced Efficiency:** Price floors can lead to a reduction in economic efficiency. Resources might be misallocated, as some producers who are willing to sell at the equilibrium price might not be able to sell their products due to the higher price floor.
- **Consumer Impact:** While price floors are often implemented to protect consumers from extremely low prices, they can have unintended consequences.
- **Producer Impact:** Price floors can benefit producers by guaranteeing them a higher price for their goods or services.

> A **binding price floor** :: It is a price floor that is <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">set above the equilibrium price</mark>.  #AOSR/3kcan/s/1vm4

#/Q 

#Q
> A **non-binding price** floor :: It is a price floor that is <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">set below the equilibrium price.</mark> 

#/Q 

#Q
Pros of price controls ::
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Protect consumers from exploitation</mark>: Price controls can help to protect consumers from paying too high a price for essential goods and services.
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Promote economic stability</mark>: Price controls can help to promote economic stability by preventing sharp fluctuations in prices. 
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Ensure fair wages</mark>: Price controls can help to ensure that workers are paid a fair wage for their labor. 
#/Q 

#Q 
Cons of price controls::
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Lead to shortages</mark>: Price controls can lead to shortages of goods and services, as suppliers are not able to charge a price that reflects the true value of their goods or services. 
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Create black markets</mark>: Price controls can create black markets, where goods and services are sold illegally at a higher price than the controlled price. 
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Reduce efficiency</mark>: Price controls can reduce efficiency in the market, as they prevent the market from reaching equilibrium, where supply and demand are equal. 
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Distort market signals</mark>: Price controls can distort market signals, making it difficult for producers to make informed decisions about how much to produce and how much to charge.

## Taxes
#Q
Taxes :: These are <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">compulsory levies on consumers or producers by a governmental organization in order to fund government spending and various public services.</mark> 
#/Q 

#Q
**Tax on Sellers** ::
This is a tax that is <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">imposed on the producers of a good or service</mark>. The tax is usually levied per unit of output produced. The tax burden is shared by both consumers and producers, but the exact share depends on the elasticity of supply and demand.
#/Q 

When a tax is imposed on sellers,<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;"> the supply curve shifts upward</mark>, reflecting the higher cost of production. The <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">demand curve does not change.</mark> The equilibrium price increases, and the equilibrium quantity decreases.

#Q
Effects of a tax on sellers ::
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Higher prices for consumers</mark>: Consumers will have to pay a higher price for the good or service, as the tax is passed on to them.
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Lower profits for producers</mark>: Producers will receive a lower price for the good or service, as the tax reduces their profits.
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Reduced output</mark>: The tax will lead to a reduction in the output of the good or service, as producers are less willing to produce at the higher price.
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Deadweight loss</mark>: The tax will create a deadweight loss, which is the loss of economic efficiency due to the tax.
#/Q 

![[Pasted image 20230821223326.png]]

#Q
Tax on Buyers::
A tax on buyers is a tax that is <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">imposed on the consumers of a good or service. </mark>The tax is usually levied per unit of output consumed. The tax burden is shared by both consumers and producers, but the exact share depends on the elasticity of supply and demand.
#/Q 

When a tax is imposed on buyers, the demand curve shifts downward, reflecting the higher cost of consumption. The supply curve does not change. The equilibrium price increases, and the equilibrium quantity decreases.
#Q
The following are the effects of a tax on buyers ::
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Higher prices for consumers</mark>: Consumers will have to pay a higher price for the good or service, as the tax is passed on to them.
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Lower profits for producers</mark>: Producers will receive a lower price for the good or service, as the tax reduces their profits.
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Reduced output</mark>: The tax will lead to a reduction in the output of the good or service, as producers are less willing to produce at the higher price.
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Deadweight loss</mark>: The tax will create a deadweight loss, which is the loss of economic efficiency due to the tax.
#/Q 

## Tax Incidence
#Q
Tax incidence :: refers to <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">who ultimately bears the burden of a tax.</mark> The tax incidence may not be the same as the person who is legally liable to pay the tax.
#/Q 

The tax incidence will <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">depend on the elasticity of demand and supply.</mark>  If demand is inelastic, consumers are less likely to change their consumption in response to a price change. This means that the burden of the tax will fall more heavily on consumers. If supply is elastic, producers are more likely to change their production in response to a price change. This means that the burden of the tax will fall more heavily on producers.

| Elasticity      | Tax incidence                                                 |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Elastic         | Producers bear more of the burden.                            |
| Inelastic       | Consumers bear more of the burden.                            |
| Unitary elastic | The burden is shared equally between consumers and producers. |

#Q
Welfare effect of a tax :: 
The welfare effect of a tax is the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">change in economic well-being that results from the imposition of the tax.</mark> The welfare effect of tax can be measured by <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">the loss of consumer surplus and producer surplus.</mark>
#/Q 
The total welfare loss from the tax is the sum of the decrease in consumer surplus and the decrease in producer surplus. This loss is called the deadweight loss. The deadweight loss is a measure of the inefficiency that results from the tax.

The deadweight loss from a tax is larger when the elasticity of demand and supply are higher. If demand or supply is more elastic, the consumers or producers are more likely to change their behavior in response to the tax. This leads to a larger deadweight loss.

|Elasticity|Deadweight loss|
|---|---|
|Elastic|Larger deadweight loss.|
|Inelastic|Smaller deadweight loss.|
|Unitary elastic|No deadweight loss.|

## Subsidies

#Q
Subsidies :: This is a <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">financial assistance that is given by the government to producers or consumers of a good or service.</mark> Subsidies can be used to achieve a variety of goals, such as increasing production, reducing prices, or promoting certain types of economic activity.
#/Q 
The term "subsidy" is often used interchangeably with the term "grant," but there is a subtle difference between the two. A grant is a payment that is made without any expectation of repayment, while a subsidy is a payment that is made with the expectation that the recipient will use the funds to produce or consume a good or service.

Two main types of subsidies:
#Q
- Production subsidies :: are <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">payments that are made to producers of a good or service.</mark> These subsidies can be used to reduce the cost of production, which can lead to lower prices for consumers.
#/Q 
![[Pasted image 20230821230613.png]]
#Q #AOSR/5bo3h
- Consumption subsidies :: are <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">payments that are made to consumers of a good or service. </mark>These subsidies can be used to reduce the price of the good or service, which can make it more affordable for consumers to purchase.  #AOSR/5bo3h/s/r496
#/Q 

#Q
Positive impacts include ::
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Increased production</mark>: Subsidies can lead to increased production of a good or service, which can help to meet demand and reduce shortages.
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Lower prices</mark>: Subsidies can lead to lower prices for consumers, which can make goods and services more affordable.
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Increased employment</mark>: Subsidies can lead to increased employment in the industries that receive the subsidies.
#/Q 

#Q
Negative impacts of subsidies include ::
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Reduced efficiency</mark>: Subsidies can distort the market and lead to inefficient production.
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Increased budget deficit</mark>: Subsidies can be expensive for the government, which can lead to a budget deficit.
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Unfair competition</mark>: Subsidies can give businesses that receive them an unfair advantage over businesses that do not receive them.
#/Q

### Economic Incidence of a subsidy
#Q
The economic incidence of a subsidy refers to who <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">ultimately benefits from the subsidy.</mark> The economic incidence of a subsidy may not be the same as the person who is legally entitled to receive the subsidy.
#/Q 

#Q
Welfare effect of a subsidy ::
The welfare effect of a subsidy is the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">change in economic well-being that results from the introduction of the subsidy.</mark> The welfare effect can be measured by the change in consumer surplus, producer surplus, and government revenue.
#/Q 

<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">A subsidy can have a positive welfare effect if it leads to an increase in consumer surplus and producer surplus that is greater than the cost of the subsidy. </mark>However,<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> a subsidy can also have a negative welfare effect if it leads to a decrease in consumer surplus and producer surplus that is greater than the cost of the subsidy.</mark>

The deadweight loss from a subsidy is <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">the loss of economic efficiency due to the subsidy.</mark> The deadweight loss is equal to the area H in the figure.

The deadweight loss from a subsidy is larger when the elasticity of demand and supply are higher. This is because a subsidy makes the market less efficient, and the more elastic the demand and supply, the more inefficient the market becomes.
