> What is macroeconomics? How does it differ from microeconomics?

Macroeconomics and microeconomics are two major branches of economics that focus on different aspects of the economy. Here's an overview of each and how they differ:

1. Macroeconomics:
    
    - Macroeconomics is the study of the economy as a whole.
    - It examines the overall performance of the economy, including variables like Gross Domestic Product (GDP), inflation, unemployment, and economic growth.
    - Macroeconomists analyze how government policies, monetary policy, and fiscal policy impact the entire economy.
    - It aims to understand and address issues such as overall economic stability, economic growth, and the determination of key macroeconomic variables.
2. Microeconomics:
    
    - Microeconomics is the study of individual economic units, such as households, firms, and markets.
    - It examines issues like supply and demand, market prices, consumer behavior, producer behavior, and the allocation of resources in specific markets.
    - Microeconomists are concerned with topics like individual consumer preferences, production costs, market structures, and pricing strategies of firms.
    - It helps in understanding the behavior of individual economic agents and how their decisions impact resource allocation and market outcomes.

**Reasons for deviating from the goals**

> Briefly discuss the impact of those issues on construction sector performance of Sri Lanka

The macroeconomic issues that Sri Lanka is currently facing are having a significant negative impact on the construction sector.

- **High inflation:** High inflation is driving up the cost of construction materials and labor, which is putting upward pressure on construction costs. 
- **Economic recession:** The economic recession is leading to a decline in demand for construction services.
