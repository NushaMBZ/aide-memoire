## Theory of Absolute Advantage
#Q #AOSR/7epib
The theory of absolute advantage :: is an economic theory that states that a country should <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">specialize in the production of goods and services in which it has an absolute advantage and trade those goods and services with other countries for goods and services in which those countries have an absolute advantage.</mark> #AOSR/7epib/s/5ern

## Production Possibilities Frontier
#Q #AOSR/50prm
(PPF) :: is a curve that shows all the possible combinations of two goods that can be produced by an economy with a given amount of resources.  #AOSR/50prm/s/47al
#/Q 

The PPF is typically drawn <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">with two goods on the axes</mark>, such as cars and computers. The points on the PPF represent efficient production levels, meaning that the economy is using all of its resources and producing the maximum output possible.

## The theory of comparative advantage

Comparative advantage :: is an economy's ability to produce a particular good or service at a lower opportunity cost than its trading partners. #AOSR/9t7ok/s/1kl1

The theory of comparative advantage assumes that countries have different opportunity costs in the production of different goods and services. 


**Assumptions underlying the theory of absolute advantage  and the theory of comparative advantage**

A number of assumptions are implicit in the above two models. They are given below:

- Two-countries and two-goods:  The above models considered only two countries and two goods. 
- Full employment of resources  The above models considered one composite resource bundle and it was  implicitly assumed that the resources are fully utilized in production of various  combinations of the two goods. 
- Perfect mobility of resources between enterprises  It is assumed that when resources are released from one enterprise, it is fully  absorbed by the other enterprise.
- Complete immobility of resources in a given country  The above models consider that commodities are traded between countries, yet  the resources are non-tradable. 
- Constant costs  The number of units of resources required to produce a unit of good is considered  as fixed in these models indicating that the industries are having constant costs.  
- Non-consideration of preferences of the consumers  The models used above do not take into consideration the preferences of the  consumers in computing gains from trade in an explicit manner.

## Sources of comparative advantage  
#Q 
Sources of comparative advantages are ::
- **Natural resources:** Countries with abundant natural resources may have a comparative advantage in the production of goods and services that use those resources.
- **Labor:** Countries with a skilled or low-cost labor force may have a comparative advantage in the production of goods and services that require a lot of labor. 
- **Capital:** Countries with a lot of capital, such as machines and factories, may have a comparative advantage in the production of goods and services that require a lot of capital.
- **Technology:** Countries with advanced technology may have a comparative advantage in the production of goods and services that require that technology. 
- **Infrastructure:** Countries with good infrastructure, such as roads, ports, and airports, may have a comparative advantage in the production of goods and services that require that infrastructure. 
- **Government policies:** Government policies, such as subsidies and tax breaks, can also affect a country's comparative advantage.
