# Perfect Competition
## Competitive Market
#Q #AOSR/5ok74
A competitive market :: is a market structure where <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">there are many buyers and sellers of a homogeneous product.</mark> This means that the products sold by different firms are identical, and buyers have perfect information about the prices offered by all firms. #AOSR/5ok74/s/37of
#/Q 

In a competitive market, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">no individual buyer or seller has any control over the market price.</mark> The price is determined by the interaction of supply and demand in the market as a whole.

As a result, <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">firms in competitive markets are price takers.</mark> They <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">must accept the market price and cannot charge more or less for their products.</mark>
#Q
Characteristics of a competitive market ::
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Many buyers and sellers</mark>. There are so many buyers and sellers in a competitive market that no individual buyer or seller can have a significant impact on the market price.
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Homogeneous products</mark>. The products sold by different firms in a perfectly competitive market are identical. This means that buyers are indifferent about which firm they buy from.
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Free entry and exit</mark>. Firms are free to enter and exit the market in a perfectly competitive market.
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Perfect information</mark>. Buyers and sellers in a perfectly competitive market have perfect information about the prices offered by all firms.

## Revenue of a Competitive Firm

This is the total amount of money the firm earns by selling its output. In a *perfectly competitive market*, the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">revenue of a firm is equal to the market price of the product multiplied by the quantity of output sold.</mark> This can be expressed mathematically as: 
$$
TR = P \cdot Q
$$
#Q #AOSR/79vr2
In a perfectly competitive market, ==the average revenue and marginal revenue of the firm are Here are the equal to the market price. == #AOSR/79vr2/c/picn 
#/Q 

To show this, we can substitute the expression for total revenue into the expression for average revenue:
$$
\begin{align*}
AR &= \dfrac{TR}{Q} \\
&= \dfrac{P \cdot Q}{Q} \\
&= P
\end{align*}
$$
We can also show that the marginal revenue is equal to the price by differentiating the expression for total revenue:
$$
\begin{align*}
MR &= \dfrac{dTR}{dQ} \\
&= \dfrac{d}{dQ} (P \cdot Q) \\
&= P \cdot \dfrac{d}{dQ} Q \\
&= P \cdot 1 \\
&= P
\end{align*}
$$
Therefore, in a perfectly competitive market, AR=MR=P.

## Profit Maximisation

Let $TR$ be the total revenue, $TC$ be the total cost, $MR$ be the marginal revenue, and $MC$ be the marginal cost. The profit of the firm is given by:
$$
\text{Profit} = TR - TC
$$
#Q #AOSR/57aj3
The firm can maximize its profit by ==setting MR = MC.== #AOSR/57aj3/c/3l33  This is because when ==MR = MC== #AOSR/57aj3/c/uqm5  the firm is making the most money possible from each additional unit of output produced. If $MR > MC$, the firm can make more money by producing more output. If $MR < MC$, the firm can make more money by producing less output.
#/Q 
$$
\begin{align*}
MR &= \dfrac{dTR}{dQ} \\
MC &= \dfrac{dTC}{dQ}
\end{align*}
$$
To prove this, we can differentiate the profit function:
$$
\begin{align*}
\dfrac{dProfit}{dQ} &= \dfrac{d}{dQ} (TR - TC) \\
&= \dfrac{d}{dQ} (MR - MC) \\
&= MR' - MC'
\end{align*}
$$
The profit is maximized when $\dfrac{dProfit}{dQ} = 0$. This occurs when $MR' = MC'$, which is equivalent to $MR = MC$.

## Supply Curve in a Competitive Market  

A supply curve in a competitive market is a graphical representation of the relationship between the quantity of a good or service that a firm is willing and able to supply and the price of that good or service.
![[Pasted image 20230822084641.png]]

This figure shows the relationship between costs and revenue with the quantity of output.  Marginal Cost (MC) curve is upward sloping, Average Total Cost (ATC) curve is ‘U’  shaped and Average Variable Cost (AVC) curve is below the AVC curve.  AVC curve is  first declining and after a minimum it is increasing. The price line is horizontal which  represents the Marginal Revenue (MR) and Average Revenue (AR) considering the fact  that in a competitive market, MR=MC=P (equation 9) at the profit maximisation output  level. Therefore, the firm should come to $𝑄_{MAX}$  output level from $𝑄_1$ or $𝑄_2$ production  levels.   

## Firm’s Short Run Decision to Shut Down
#Q #AOSR/39j69
A firm's short-run decision to shut down :: is the decision <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">to stop production temporarily</mark>, even though it is still able to operate. This decision is made when the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">firm is not covering its variable costs</mark>, which are the costs that change with the quantity of output produced. #AOSR/39j69/s/4a8p
$$
P<AVC
$$
$$
TR<TVC
$$
#/Q
#Q
There are <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">two reasons why a firm might shut down</mark> in the short run. ::
- First, <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">the price might be below the minimum average variable cost</mark>. This means that the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">firm is making a loss on each unit of output produced.</mark>
- Second, the firm might be facing a temporary shock, such as a <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">decline in demand</mark>, that makes it unprofitable to produce.
$$
\begin{align}
\frac{TR}{Q}<\frac{TC}{Q} \\
P<ATC
\end{align}
$$
#/Q 

When a firm shuts down, it still has to pay its fixed costs, which are the costs that do not change with the quantity of output produced. However, by shutting down, the firm can avoid paying its variable costs. This can help the firm to avoid making a larger loss.

The decision to shut down is a short-run decision. In the long run, the firm can choose to exit the market altogether if it is not profitable to operate.

## Measuring Profits of a Competitive Firm
#Q #AOSR/2jgk5
Profit is :: the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">total revenue a firm earns minus its total costs.</mark> In a perfectly competitive market, a firm is a price taker, meaning that it cannot control the market price. As a result, the firm's profit is determined by the difference between the market price and its average total cost. #AOSR/2jgk5/s/7ue7

```
Profit = (Price - ATC) * Q
```
#/Q 
Let Profit be $Π$, AR be average revenue, ATC be average total cost, and Q be the quantity of output produced.

The profit can be expressed as:
$$
\begin{align*}
Π &= TR - TC \\
&= (AR * Q) - (ATC * Q) \\
&= (AR - ATC) * Q
\end{align*}
$$
The market price is equal to the average revenue, so we can substitute P for AR:
$$
\begin{align*}
Π &= (P * Q) - (ATC * Q) \\
&= (P - ATC) * Q
\end{align*}
$$
Therefore, profit can be expressed as either $(AR - ATC) * Q \text{ or } (P - ATC) * Q$.

## Supply Curve of a Competitive Market
#Q
Short Run Market Supply Curve ::
- In the short run, the number of firms is fixed, so the supply curve is <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">determined by the marginal cost curve</mark> of the individual firms.
- The <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">supply curve is upward sloping</mark> because <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">as the price increases, firms are willing to produce more output.</mark>
- This is because the marginal cost curve is also upward sloping.
- The marginal cost curve shows the additional cost of producing one more unit of output.
#/Q 
#Q
Long Run Market Supply Curve ::
- In the long run, <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">firms can enter and exit the market</mark>, so the supply curve is determined by the average total cost curve of the marginal firm.
- The marginal firm is the firm that is just breaking even.
- If the price is above the average total cost of the marginal firm, then firms will enter the market, which will increase the supply and lower the price.
- If the price is below the average total cost of the marginal firm, then firms will exit the market, which will decrease the supply and raise the price.

#/Q 
#Q #AOSR/7gqcf
Why the Firms Stay in Business with Zero Profits? ::  #AOSR/7gqcf/s/9i1b
- Profit is considered as the total revenue less total cost.
- In computing total cost; the opportunity cost of the business owner has taken into account.
- Therefore, his inputs as labour, entrepreneurship, money and land are adequately compensated in the zero economic profit equilibrium.
- This compensation keeps the firms in production at the zero profit level.
#/Q 

#Q
Shift in Demand in Short Run and Long Run ::
- When the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">market demand shifts outwards</mark>, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">the price will increase in the short run.</mark>
- This is because the existing firms will be able to sell more output at the higher price.
- In the long run, more firms will enter the market, which will increase the supply and lower the price.
- The new equilibrium price will be lower than the old equilibrium price, but it will still be higher than the average total cost of the marginal firm.

![[Pasted image 20230822092058.png]]
#Q
Long Run Supply Curve ::
- The long run supply curve is expected to be horizontal in a perfectly competitive market.
- This is because all firms will eventually make zero economic profit in the long run.
- However, the long run supply curve may not be horizontal in reality due to limitations in resources and variations in cost of resources.
