## Data Structures

A data structure is a <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">specialized way to organize and store data in a computer's memory to make it easier to access and modify.</mark>

### Characteristic Types of Data Structures

| Characteristic  | Description                                                                        |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Linear          | data objects are arranged in a `linear sequence`                                   |
| Non-Linear      | data objects are not arranged in a `linear sequence`                               |
| Homogeneous     | all the elements are of same type                                                  |
| Non-Homogeneous | the elements may or may not be of the same type                                    |
| Static          | size,  structures, and associated memory location are fixed.                       |
| Dynamic         | structures that expand or shrink based on the the program need and it's execution. |
### Basic Types of Data Structures

- Built-in Data Type
	- These are data types for which a language has built-in support.
		- Integers, Boolean, Float, String
- Derived Data Type
	- Data types that are normally built on top of `built-in` data types.
		- List, Array, Stack, Queue

## Array

Array is a data type that can <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">hold fixed number of items.</mark> Unique aspect of `array` is that <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">data stored in an array should be of the same type.</mark>

![[Pasted image 20240225115225.png]]
**Python**
```python
import array as arr 

# Array of integers
num_array = arr.array('i', [2, 5, 8])   
print(num_array[0])         # Output: 2

# Array of floating-point numbers
float_array = arr.array('d', [3.14, 2.71, 5.5])
```
**Java**
```java
// Array of integers
int[] numbers = {2, 10, 5, 16, 20, 6}; 


// Array of Strings 
String[] names = new String[]{"Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"};  
```
**CPP**
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    // Array of integers
    int numbers[5] = {3, 7, 1, 9, 4};

    // Array of strings (using C-style strings)
    char names[3][10] = {"Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"};  

    return 0;
}
```

## Linked List

A linked list is a linear data structure where each element (called a node) is connected to the next element by a link, instead of being stored contiguously in memory.

## Key Characteristics

- **Nodes:** Each node consists of data and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the list.
- **Head:** The first node in the list is called the head.
- **Tail:** The last node in the list is called the tail. It usually has a `next` pointer set to `None` or `null`, indicating the end of the list.
- **Dynamic size:** Linked lists can grow or shrink in size as needed, unlike arrays which have a fixed size.
- **Insertion and deletion:** Inserting or deleting nodes can be done efficiently at any point in the list, unlike arrays where elements need to be shifted to make space.

### Types of Linked List

**Singly Linked List**

- **Structure:** The most basic type of linked list. Each node contains:
    - **Data:** The information you want to store.
    - **Next Pointer:** A pointer (or reference) to the next node in the sequence.
- **Traversal:** You can only <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">move forward through the list</mark>, from the head to the tail.

**Python**
```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None

class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None

    # Insert at the beginning
    def insert_at_beginning(self, data):
        new_node = Node(data)
        new_node.next = self.head
        self.head = new_node

    # Insert at the end
    def insert_at_end(self, data):
        new_node = Node(data)
        if self.head is None:
            self.head = new_node
            return

        last = self.head
        while last.next:
            last = last.next
        last.next = new_node

    # Print the list
    def print_list(self):
        node = self.head
        while node:
            print(node.data, end=" -> ")
            node = node.next
        print("NULL")
```

**Java**
```java
class Node {
    int data;
    Node next;

    // Constructor
    Node(int data) {
        this.data = data;
        next = null;   // Initially, next points to null
    }
}

class SinglyLinkedList {
    Node head;  // Head of the list

    // Insert a new node at the beginning
    public void insertAtBeginning(int data) {
        Node newNode = new Node(data); 
        newNode.next = head;  
        head = newNode; 
    }

    // Insert a new node at the end
    public void insertAtEnd(int data) {
        Node newNode = new Node(data);

        if (head == null) {
            head = newNode;
            return;
        }

        // Traverse to the end 
        Node current = head;
        while (current.next != null) {
            current = current.next; 
        }
        current.next = newNode; 
    }

    // Print the linked list
    public void printList() {
        Node current = head;
        while (current != null) {
            System.out.print(current.data + " -> ");
            current = current.next;
        }
        System.out.println("NULL"); 
    }

    // Demonstration
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SinglyLinkedList list = new SinglyLinkedList();

        list.insertAtEnd(1);
        list.insertAtBeginning(2);
        list.insertAtBeginning(3);
        list.insertAtEnd(4);

        System.out.println("Created Linked List: ");
        list.printList();  // Output: 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> NULL
    }
}
```

**2. Doubly Linked List**

- **Structure:** Each node contains:
    - **Data:** The information you want to store.
    - **Next Pointer:** A pointer to the next node in the sequence.
    - **Previous Pointer:** A pointer to the previous node in the sequence.
- **Traversal:** You can <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">traverse forward and backward</mark>, giving more flexibility.

![[Pasted image 20240225121117.png]]

**Java**
```java
class DoublyNode {
    int data;
    DoublyNode prev;
    DoublyNode next;

    DoublyNode(int data) { 
        this.data = data; 
    } 
}

class DoublyLinkedList {
    DoublyNode head;

    // Insert a node at the beginning
    public void insertAtBeginning(int data) {
        DoublyNode newNode = new DoublyNode(data);
        newNode.next = head; 
        if (head != null) {
            head.prev = newNode; 
        }
        head = newNode; 
    }

    // Insert a node at the end 
    public void insertAtEnd(int data) {
        DoublyNode newNode = new DoublyNode(data);
        if (head == null) { 
            head = newNode; 
            return; 
        }
        DoublyNode current = head;
        while (current.next != null) {
            current = current.next; 
        }
        current.next = newNode; 
        newNode.prev = current;
    }

    // Print the list in forward order
    public void printList() {
        DoublyNode node = head;
        while (node != null) {
            System.out.print(node.data + " <-> ");
            node = node.next;
        }
        System.out.println("NULL");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        DoublyLinkedList list = new DoublyLinkedList();
        list.insertAtEnd(1);
        list.insertAtBeginning(2);
        list.insertAtEnd(3);

        System.out.println("Doubly Linked List:");
        list.printList();  // Output: 2 <-> 1 <-> 3 <-> NULL
    }
}
```

**Python**
```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.prev = None
        self.next = None

class DoublyLinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None

    # Insert at the beginning
    def insert_at_beginning(self, data):
        new_node = Node(data)
        new_node.next = self.head
        if self.head is not None:
            self.head.prev = new_node
        self.head = new_node

    # Insert at the end 
    def insert_at_end(self, data):
        new_node = Node(data)
        if self.head is None:
            self.head = new_node
            return

        last = self.head
        while last.next:
            last = last.next
        last.next = new_node
        new_node.prev = last

    # Print the list (forward direction)
    def print_list(self):
        node = self.head
        while node:
            print(node.data, end=" <-> ")
            node = node.next
        print("NULL")

# Demonstration
if __name__ == '__main__':
    dllist = DoublyLinkedList()
    dllist.insert_at_end(1)
    dllist.insert_at_beginning(2)
    dllist.insert_at_beginning(3)
    dllist.insert_at_end(4)

    print("Created Doubly Linked List: ")
    dllist.print_list()  # Output: 3 <-> 2 <-> 1 <-> 4 <-> NULL
```

**3. Circular Linked List**

- **Structure:** Similar to a singly linked list, but the last node's `next` pointer points back to the head node, forming a circle.
- **Traversal:** You can <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">start at any node and traverse the entire list.</mark> There's no well-defined beginning or end unless you intentionally mark a node.

![[Pasted image 20240225121135.png]]

## Stack

 A stack is an abstract data type (ADT), meaning it's a theoretical model of how data is organized and what operations you can perform on it.

> [!note]
> <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Stacks operate on the LIFO principle</mark> – Last In, First Out. Think of a stack of plates: the last plate you put on the stack is the first one you take off.

Imagine a vertical stack of items. You can only add items to the top or remove items from the top.

```
[    ]  <-- Top (most recently added element)
[    ]
[    ]
[    ]  <-- Bottom
```

## Queue

Like stack, a queue is an abstract data type (ADT), providing a model for how to store and manipulate a collection of elements.

> [!note]
> <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Queues operate on the FIFO principle</mark> – First In, First Out. This is analogous to a line of people waiting for a service; the first person in line gets served first.


Imagine a horizontal line. You add people to the back, and they are served (removed) from the front.

```
Front -> [  ] [  ] [  ] <- Rear (where elements are added)
```

## Graph

 A graph is a <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">non-linear data structure that models relationships between objects.</mark>

- **Components:**
    - **Vertices (or nodes):** The objects or entities being represented in the graph.
    - **Edges:** The connections or relationships between the vertices.

**Types of Graphs**

- **Directed vs. Undirected Graphs**
    
    - **Directed Graphs (Digraphs):** Edges have a defined direction, like a one-way street. (Vertex A → Vertex B)
    - **Undirected Graphs:** Edges are bidirectional, like a regular street where traffic can flow both ways. (Vertex A ↔ Vertex B)
- **Weighted vs. Unweighted Graphs**
    
    - **Weighted Graphs:** Edges carry a value or weight representing cost, distance, capacity, or another attribute.
    - **Unweighted Graphs:** Edges only signify a connection, not a specific cost.

## Tree

A tree is a hierarchical data structure that models relationships between items (nodes) where each node can have multiple child nodes but only one parent node.

- **Components:**
    
    - **Nodes:** The data elements of the tree.
    - **Edges:** Connections between nodes, representing parent-child relationships.
    - **Root Node:** The topmost node in the tree, with no parent.

**Types of Trees:**

- **Binary Trees:** Each node has at most two child nodes.
- **Binary Search Trees (BSTs):** A specific type of binary tree where the data in each node is greater than all the data in its left child node and less than all the data in its right child node.
- **Balanced Trees:** A type of tree where the heights of the left and right subtrees of each node are roughly equal, reducing the search time.
- **N-ary Trees:** Each node can have more than two child nodes.

|Property|Binary Tree|Binary Search Tree (BST)|Balanced Tree|N-ary Tree|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Maximum number of children per node|2|2|Varies depending on the specific type|N|
|Ordering of data|No specific order|Left child < Node < Right child|Nodes are roughly balanced|No specific order|
## Recursion

Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself directly or indirectly. 

In the case of Fibonacci numbers, the function `fibonacci(n)` calculates the nth Fibonacci number by calling itself twice, once with `n-1` and once with `n-2` as arguments. This is because the nth Fibonacci number is defined as the sum of the $(n-1)^{th}$ and $(n-2)^{th}$ Fibonacci numbers.

```python
def fibonacci(n):
  """
  This function calculates the nth Fibonacci number using recursion.

  Args:
    n: The index of the Fibonacci number to calculate.

  Returns:
    The nth Fibonacci number.
  """

  if n <= 1:
    return n
  else:
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```
