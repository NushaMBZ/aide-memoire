# Design Patterns
#Q #AOSR/75jm7
Design patterns ::Â are <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">typical solutions to common problems</mark> in software design. #AOSR/75jm7/s/53fg
#/Q 
Design patterns are <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">reusable  to commonly occurring design problems</mark> in software development.

## Advantages
#Q
Key benefits of design patterns ::
1. **Reusability:** Design patterns provide reusable solutions to common problems in software design.
    
2. **Maintainability:** Design patterns promote clean and organized code structures.
    
3. **Scalability:** Design patterns help create flexible and extensible code. 
    
4. **Abstraction:** Patterns abstract common design principles into well-defined templates. 
    
5. **Communication:** Design patterns provide a common vocabulary for developers to discuss and communicate design decisions.
    
6. **Testability:** Code structured using design patterns often leads to more testable software. 
    
7. **Performance Optimization:** Some design patterns, such as the Singleton pattern, can help optimize performance by ensuring that specific objects are instantiated only once.
#/Q 
## Elements of Design Patterns

1. **Pattern Name**: A descriptive name that represents the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">essence of the pattern.</mark> 
    
2. **Problem**: A <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">description of the design problem</mark> or scenario that the pattern addresses. 
    
3. **Solution**: The actual <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">design solution</mark> that addresses the problem.
	   
4. **Consequences and trade-offs of application**: Consequences are the outcomes or effects that result from applying a design pattern to your software design. Trade-offs are the compromises you make when choosing a particular design pattern.

## Classification of Design Patterns

#Q #AOSR/3bf4v
- Creational Patterns :: Creational patterns deal with the process of <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">object creation.</mark> They provide ways to instantiate objects while hiding the exact logic of how objects are created and initialized. #AOSR/3bf4v/s/3m08
#/Q 

#Q #AOSR/1pjr4
- Structural Patterns :: Structural patterns is **a blueprint of <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">how different objects and classes are combined together to form a bigger structure</mark> for achieving multiple goals altogether**. #AOSR/1pjr4/s/5ijg
#/Q 

#Q #AOSR/2fr2o
- Behavioral Patterns :: Behavioral patterns are concerned with the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">interactions between objects and the distribution of responsibilities.</mark> #AOSR/2fr2o/s/70ud
#/Q 

### Creational Design Patterns
#### Singleton Pattern
#Q #AOSR/58ck3
Singleton Pattern :: Ensures that a class has <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.</mark> #AOSR/58ck3/s/6pua
![[Pasted image 20231008194706.png]]
#/Q 

```java
public class Singleton {
    // Private static instance variable
    private static Singleton instance;

    // Private constructor to prevent instantiation from other classes
    private Singleton() {
        // Initialization code, if needed
    }

    // Public method to get the singleton instance
    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }

    // Other methods and fields can be added here as needed
}

```
#### Factory Method Pattern
#Q #AOSR/5640r
Factory Method Pattern :: is <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">an interface for creating objects but allows subclasses to decide which class to instantiate.</mark> #AOSR/5640r/s/51p5

![[Pasted image 20231008202627.png]]
#/Q 

#### Abstract Factory Pattern
#Q #AOSR/6vrhk
Abstract Factory Pattern :: provides <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.</mark> #AOSR/6vrhk/s/5uvr
![[Pasted image 20231008203620.png]]
#/Q
#### Builder Pattern
#Q #AOSR/4194s
Builder pattern :: <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">separates the construction of a complex object from its representation</mark>, allowing the same construction process to create different representations. #AOSR/4194s/s/2fv3
![[Pasted image 20231008204258.png]]
#/Q
### Structural Design Patterns
#### Composite Pattern 
#Q #AOSR/434h8
The Composite Pattern :: is used to <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.  #AOSR/434h8/s/7vvc
</mark> #AOSR/434h8/s/7gr3
![[Pasted image 20231008205230.png]]
#/Q
#### Adapter Pattern
#Q #AOSR/2fbpq
The Adapter Pattern :: also known as the Wrapper pattern, <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together.</mark> #AOSR/2fbpq/s/4dun
#/Q
#### Proxy Pattern
#Q #AOSR/ao0sr
The Proxy Pattern :: provides a <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access, add security, or provide additional functionality.</mark> #AOSR/ao0sr/s/hnho
#/Q
#### Facade Pattern
#Q #AOSR/6jasi
The Facade Pattern :: provides a <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">simplified interface to a complex subsystem, making it easier to interact with and understand.</mark> #AOSR/6jasi/s/5kti
#/Q

### Behavioral Design Patterns
#### Observer Pattern 
#Q #AOSR/3pvub
The Observer Pattern :: defines a <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">one-to-many dependency between objects, where when one object (the subject) changes state, all its dependents (observers) are notified and updated automatically.</mark> #AOSR/3pvub/s/z772
#/Q
#### Template Pattern 
#Q #AOSR/4la14
The Template Pattern :: defines the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">structure of an algorithm in a superclass but allows subclasses to override specific steps of the algorithm.</mark> #AOSR/4la14/s/1rtr
#/Q
#### Strategy Pattern
#Q #AOSR/5kuu4
The Strategy Pattern :: defines a <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">family of interchangeable algorithms and allows them to be used interchangeably within a context.</mark> #AOSR/5kuu4/s/6c9c

#Q #AOSR/7m9mu
The Iterator Pattern :: provides a way to <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">access elements of a collection without exposing its underlying representation.</mark> #AOSR/7m9mu/s/4rmh
