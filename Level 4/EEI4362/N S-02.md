# Unified Modeling Language
#Q #AOSR/clvjk
Unified Modeling Language :: is a standardized, general-purpose modeling language used to visualize, design, specify, and document the structure and behavior of software systems.  #AOSR/clvjk/s/1fou
#/Q

> [!tip] 
> UML provides a set of notations and diagrams for modeling various aspects of a software system, making it a powerful tool for communication and analysis during the software development process.

## Groupings of Diagrams

### Structural Diagrams 
#Q #AOSR/7h2t2
- Class Diagram :: Class diagrams depict the static structure of a system, showing the classes, their attributes, methods, and the relationships between them.  #AOSR/7h2t2/s/2cic
#/Q
        
#Q #AOSR/6radt
- Object Diagram :: Object diagrams represent a snapshot of the objects and their relationships at a specific point in time. #AOSR/6radt/s/6gif
#/Q 
        
#Q
- Component Diagram :: Component diagrams focus on the organization and dependencies of the physical components or modules that make up a system.
#/Q
        
#Q
- Package Diagram :: Package diagrams help organize the elements of a system into packages, showing how classes and other elements are grouped into larger units for better management and modularity.
#/Q
        
#Q
- Composite Structure Diagram :: Composite structure diagrams depict the internal structure of a class, component, or collaboration, showing how its parts are connected and interact.
#/Q

### Behavioral Diagrams

#Q
- Use Case Diagram :: Use case diagrams represent the functional requirements of a system from the perspective of its users.
#/Q
        
#Q #AOSR/79upp
- Sequence Diagram :: Sequence diagrams illustrate the interactions between objects over time, showing the order of messages and their relationships. #AOSR/79upp/s/54u0
#/Q
        
#Q
- Activity Diagram :: Activity diagrams provide a visual representation of the workflow or business processes in a system.
#/Q
        
#Q
- State Machine Diagram :: State machine diagrams model the dynamic behavior of an object, showing its states and the transitions between those states.
#/Q
        
#Q #AOSR/4edhh
- Interaction Overview Diagram :: Interaction overview diagrams combine elements from various interaction diagrams (e.g., sequence diagrams, activity diagrams) to provide a high-level view of interactions and control flow. #AOSR/4edhh/s/438j
#/Q

## Grouping of Relationships

### Structural Relationships

#Q
- Association :: A structural relationship that represents a connection or link between classes or objects. 
#/Q
        
#Q
- Aggregation :: A form of association that represents a "whole-part" relationship.
#/Q
		   
#Q
- Composition :: A stronger form of aggregation that signifies a strong ownership relationship between the whole and its parts. 
#/Q
        
#Q #AOSR/5kot4
- Generalization (Inheritance) :: A structural relationship that defines a superclass-subclass relationship between classes.  #AOSR/5kot4/s/6fnj
#/Q
        
#Q
- Realization :: A structural relationship that represents the implementation of an interface by a class.
#/Q

### Behavioral Relationships

#Q
- Dependency :: A behavioral relationship that represents a weaker form of association. 
#/Q
        
#Q
- Association :: While associations are primarily structural, they can also represent behavioral relationships by indicating that objects of one class interact with objects of another class.
#/Q
        
#Q
- Generalization (Inheritance) :: While generalization is primarily a structural relationship, it also has behavioral implications. 
#/Q
        
#Q
- Realization :: Realization is a behavioral relationship when it connects a class to an interface.
