# Data Types

1. **Primitive Data Types**: These data types represent single values and are not objects.
    
    - **byte**: 8-bit integer.
    - **short**: 16-bit integer.
    - **int**: 32-bit integer.
    - **long**: 64-bit integer.
    - **float**: 32-bit floating-point number.
    - **double**: 64-bit floating-point number.
    - **char**: 16-bit Unicode character.
    - **boolean**: Represents a true or false value.
2. **Reference Data Types**: These data types are used to create objects and reference them. These include:
    
    - **Classes**: User-defined data types.
    - **Interfaces**: Defines a contract for classes to implement.
    - **Arrays**: A collection of elements of the same data type.
3. **Wrapper Classes**: These are classes that provide a way to use primitive data types as objects. They include:
    
    - **Byte**
    - **Short**
    - **Integer**
    - **Long**
    - **Float**
    - **Double**
    - **Character**
    - **Boolean**
4. **Enumeration (Enum)**: An enumeration is a special type used to define a collection of constants.
    
5. **String**: Java has a built-in class called `String` to work with text as a sequence of characters.
    
6. **User-Defined Data Types**: Java allows you to create your own data types using classes and interfaces. These can be quite complex and tailored to the needs of your program.
    
7. **Array Types**: You can create arrays of any data type. For example, you can have an array of integers, an array of strings, and so on.
    
8. **Generics**: Java supports generics, which allow you to create classes, interfaces, and methods that operate on typed parameters. Generics enable you to create more flexible and type-safe data structures and algorithms.
    
9. **Null Type**: There is a special type in Java called `null`, which represents the absence of a value. It is used for variables that don't currently reference any object.
    
10. **Custom Data Types**: You can define your own custom data types by creating classes and structures tailored to your specific application needs.
