```
my thread createdThread[my runnable thread,5,main]
Printing the count 0
Main thread will be alive
Printing the count 1
Main thread will be alive
Printing the count 2
Main thread will be alive
Printing the count 3
Main thread will be alive
Printing the count 4
Main thread will be alive
my thread run is over
Main thread run is over
```

Here's an explanation of this output:

1. The "my runnable thread" is created, and its name and ID are printed.
    
2. The "my runnable thread" starts running, and it enters the `run` method. It prints "Printing the count 0" and then sleeps for 1 second.
    
3. The main thread enters the while loop and prints "Main thread will be alive."
    
4. This pattern continues as the "my runnable thread" counts from 0 to 4, printing and sleeping.
    
5. After the "my runnable thread" completes its work, it prints "my thread run is over."
    
6. The main thread continues to execute the loop, periodically printing "Main thread will be alive" until it detects that the "my runnable thread" has finished.
    
7. Once the "my runnable thread" has finished, the main thread also prints "Main thread run is over," and the program terminates.
