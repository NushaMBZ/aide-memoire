## **Elements of the Object Model**

#Q #AOSR/4g6l4
The four major elements of the object model (the conceptual framework of an object-oriented thing) ::
1. Abstraction
2. Encapsulation
3. Modularity
4. Hierarchy

#Q
The three minor elements ::
1. Typing
2. Concurrency
3. Persistence.

The major elements are essential whereas the minor ones are useful but not essential. Now we try to elaborately define major elements and minor elements.

### **Major Elements**

The major elements are listed below.

#### Abstraction

An abstraction denotes the <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">essential characteristics of an object that distinguish it from all other kinds of objects. </mark>Thus it provides crisply defined conceptual boundaries, relative to the perspective of the viewer.

#### Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the process of <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">compartmentalizing the elements of an abstraction that constitutes its structure and behavior.</mark>

#### Modularity

Modularity is the<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;"> property of a system that has been decomposed into a set of cohesive and loosely coupled modules.</mark>

#### Hierarchy

Hierarchy <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">is a ranking of ordering of abstractions.</mark> The two most important hierarchies in a complex system are its <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">class structure</mark> (‘is a’ or Generalization/specialization) and <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">object structure</mark> (‘part of’ or whole part).
### Minor Elements

The minor elements are listed below.

#### Typing

Concepts of typing derive primarily from theories of abstract data types. A type is a precise characterization of structural or behavioral which a collection of entities all share. 

#### Concurrency

It is the property that distinguishes an active object from one that is not active.

#### Persistence

Is the property of an object through which its existence transcends time (i.e. the object continues to exist after its creator ceases to exist) and/or space (i.e. the object’s location moves from the address space in which it was created).
