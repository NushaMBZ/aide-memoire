	- Users should have the ability to <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">undo or exit actions easily and recover from errors without any negative consequences.</mark>
- **Consistency and standards**
	- The system should <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">follow established conventions and display consistent terminology, design elements, and interaction patterns.</mark>
- **Error prevention**
	- The design should incorporate measures to <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">prevent errors from occurring in the first place</mark>, such as clear instructions and constraints on user actions.
- **Recognition rather than recall**
	- Users should be able to <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">recognize options and actions within the interface</mark> instead of relying on recall or memorization.
- **Flexibility and efficiency of use**
	- The interface should <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">cater to both novice and expert users, allowing them to accomplish tasks in the most efficient way possible.</mark>
- **Aesthetic and minimalist design**
	- The interface should be <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">visually appealing and present only the necessary information, avoiding clutter or unnecessary complexity.</mark>
- **Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors**
	- Error messages should be <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">clear, concise, and suggest specific actions to resolve the issue.</mark>

## User-Centered Design
User-centered design (UCD) is an iterative design approach that focuses on <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">understanding and addressing the needs, goals, and preferences of the end-users</mark> throughout the design process.

### Design Considerations
- Abilities and needs
- Context
- Work
- Task

### Methods
1. **Understand the users:** The first step is to understand the users of the application. This includes understanding their needs, their goals, and their pain points. This can be done through user research, such as surveys, interviews, and usability testing.
2. **Design for the users:** Once you understand the users, you can design the application to meet their needs. This means using familiar terminology, metaphors, and patterns. It also means making sure that the application is easy to use and navigate.
3. **Get feedback from users:** It is important to get feedback from users throughout the design process. This will help you to ensure that the application is meeting their needs and that it is easy to use.
4. **Iterate and improve:** The design process is iterative. This means that you will need to make changes to the application as you learn more about the users and their needs. It is important to be open to feedback and to be willing to make changes.

### Challenges
- Understanding Diverse User Needs
- Balancing Stakeholder Requirements
- Limited Resources and Time Constraints

### Color Schemes
Color schemes are sets of harmonious colors derived from the color wheel, and there are three main types: analogous (adjacent colors on the wheel), complementary (opposite colors on the wheel), and monochromatic (variations of a single color).

- Analogous
	- Selecting colors between two points on the color wheel.
- Monochromatic
	- Using tints (mixing a color with white) and shades (mixing a color with black) of a single color.
- Complementary 
	- These color schemes consist of colors that are opposite to each other, creating a vibrant contrast.

## Gestalt Laws
