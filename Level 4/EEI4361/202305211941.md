# Nielsen-Molich Heuristics

The Nielsen-Molich heuristics, also known as the 10 Usability Heuristics, are a set of principles developed by Jakob Nielsen and Rolf Molich for <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">evaluating the user interface design and usability of software applications.</mark>

- **Visibility of system status**
	- The system should always provide <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">clear feedback to users about what is happenin</mark>g, such as loading progress or error messages.
- **Match between system and the real world**
	- The language, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">concepts, and actions within the system should be familiar and consistent with the user's mental model.</mark>
- **User control and freedom**
	- Users should have the ability to <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">undo or exit actions easily and recover from errors without any negative consequences.</mark>
- **Consistency and standards**
	- The system should <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">follow established conventions and display consistent terminology, design elements, and interaction patterns.</mark>
- **Error prevention**
	- The design should incorporate measures to <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">prevent errors from occurring in the first place</mark>, such as clear instructions and constraints on user actions.
- **Recognition rather than recall**
	- Users should be able to <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">recognize options and actions within the interface</mark> instead of relying on recall or memorization.
- **Flexibility and efficiency of use**
	- The interface should <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">cater to both novice and expert users, allowing them to accomplish tasks in the most efficient way possible.</mark>
- **Aesthetic and minimalist design**
	- The interface should be <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">visually appealing and present only the necessary information, avoiding clutter or unnecessary complexity.</mark>
- **Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors**
	- Error messages should be <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">clear, concise, and suggest specific actions to resolve the issue.</mark>
- **Help and documentation**
	- The system should provide <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">relevant and easily accessible help resources to assist users in understanding and using the interface effectively.</mark>

## Cognitive Walkthrough
Process of <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">systematically walking through specific tasks or scenarios from the perspective of a typical user and evaluating the ease of use and effectiveness of the interface design.</mark>

## Hierarchical task analysis (HTA) 

HTA is a method used to <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">analyze and represent the structure of tasks or activities that users perform to achieve their goals.</mark>
