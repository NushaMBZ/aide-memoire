## The Constituent Elements of a Crime
Every crime is committed through either by a <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">positive act or an omission.</mark>

Crimes consist of two broad elements:
- mens rea  - "a guilty mind."
- actus reus - "guilty act,"

These basic elements have been derived  from a cardinal principle of criminal liability which is enshrined in the Latin  maxim `actus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea` (No one should be held  guilty unless his mind is blameworthy).

## Strict Liability and Vicarious Liability

Strict liability in criminal law refers to <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">offenses where the presence of mens rea (criminal intent) is not required for one or more elements of the actus reus (criminal act).</mark>

These offenses are primarily created by statutory laws. Under strict liability, a person can be held <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">legally responsible for the consequences of their actions, even if they had no wrongful or criminal intent. </mark>

In Sri Lanka, where all offenses are established by statutes like the Penal Code, the general rule is that mens rea is required for most offenses, unless expressly excluded by the statute. This means that strict liability is rarely applicable in Sri Lanka and depends on whether mens rea has been explicitly excluded in the statute.

Vicarious liability involves holding a <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">person or entity accountable for damages or harm caused by another individual.</mark>

This legal doctrine assigns <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">liability to a person who didn't directly cause the harm but has a specific legal relationship to the person who did.</mark>

In criminal law, vicarious liability arises when one person is made liable for the criminal actions of another. Generally, criminal law focuses on individual accountability rather than attributing liability for the actions of others. However, in specific circumstances, vicarious liability is used in certain criminal cases, such as defamation. More commonly, vicarious liability is applied in civil cases, particularly in areas like employment law.
