# Formulation of Contract
A contract is a <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">legally binding agreement between two or more parties that outlines the terms and conditions under which they agree to perform certain actions, provide specific goods or services, or refrain from certain actions.</mark>

Contracts can cover a wide range of transactions, from business agreements to personal arrangements.

For a contract to be valid, it typically requires several key elements, including an offer by one party, acceptance by another party, consideration (something of value exchanged between the parties), legal capacity of the parties to enter into the contract, and a mutual intent to create legal obligations.

The requirements for the formation of a legally valid contract are,
- Minimum two parties with contractual capacity  
- Agreement between the parties by way of offer and acceptance  
- Intention of creating a legally binding agreement  
- Valuable consideration / Justa Causa  
- If law prescribes any format compline with that format

## Minimum two parties with Contractual capacity  

A party to a contract need not be a natural person, for even an artificial  person such as a corporation or incorporated company can be a party to a  contract.

In the case of natural persons, the general presumption is that all-  natural persons of full age (i.e. 18 years) have full contractual capacity.

But  there are exceptions to this general rule: law protects persons who are  labouring under certain disabilities by not giving them full contractual  capacity.

### Minority  
According to the **Age of Majority Ordinance**, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">a minor is any person under  18 years.</mark> A minor cannot enter into a contract. If a person enters into a  contract with a minor and the minor is in breach of the contract, the person  who enters into the contract cannot sues that minor.

### Insanity, drunkenness  
If a party to a contract is insane at the time of contracting, the contract is  null and void. 

### Bankruptcy
According the Insolvency Ordinance, if a person who has been declared  bankrupt (a bankrupt is one who is unable to pay his debts) makes a contract  relating to any of his insolvent property, such a contract is void.  

### Marriage  
Before the introduction of Married Women’s property Ordinance in 1923, a  married woman in regard to her right to contract was in the same position as  a minor.

## Agreement between parties by way of offer and  acceptance  

An offer is a unilateral and a definite promise given by one person to  another person. It must be accepted by the person to whom it is directed.  It can be a specific general offer.  
- Specific offer –If the promise addressed or directed to a class or a  person it is treated as specific offer  

**Boulton vs Jones [1857] 2 H & N 564, 27 LJ Ex 117**

> The defendant Jones offered to buy goods from Brocklehurst &  Co. Boulton, who was a manager of Brocklehurst & Co bought  the business of the company. On the day the offer was made he  accepted the offer and supplied the goods. Jones consumed the  goods and received an invoice made out by Boulton. Jones refused  to pay since when buying he intended to set-off the debt against  Brocklehurst & Co.  HELD No Contract was formed since the offer was not intended  for Boulton.  

**Carllil V Carbolic Smokeball Co. (1892) T.L.R. 680**

> The Company by advertisement offered to pay 100 pounds to any  person who will suffer influenza after using Carbolic Smokeball  as directed. The plaintiff used the medicine but contracted  influenza.  HELD- There was an acceptance by the performance and hence  there was a valid contract.  


### Requirements for a valid offer

For an offer to be considered valid in the context of contract law, it must fulfill certain requirements. These requirements ensure that the offer is clear, definite, and capable of forming the basis for a legally binding contract.

- Clear Intention  
- Definiteness  
- It must be seriously intended  

**Clear Intention**
This means that the offer should specially indicate what is going to be done  and to whom it is referred.

**Definiteness**
The offer must be definite. This means that the offer must not be framed  vaguely.

**Serious Intention**
This means that the offer should be seriously intended. Therefore, a  statement made as a joke does not constitute an offer.

## Why offer is different from an Invitation to treat?
Offer and Invitation to offer or invitation to treat is two different topics.  Offer can be accepted and once it is accepted it is a legally binding contract.  
![[Pasted image 20230819211207.png]]

It is very much important to look at the behavior of the parties to identify  whether the request is really an offer or an invitation to make an offer. It  depends on;  
- The intention of the parties as collected from their language.  
- The nature of the transaction.

#### Followings are some of the examples for invitation to  treat
- An advertisement for the sale of goods  
- Advertisement for tenders  
- An advertisement by an auctioneer  
- Trader's price-list  
- priced goods in a shop window  

### Types of Offers
**Optional Offers**
An optional offer is an offer where the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">offeror agrees to keep the offer open  for a definite or indefinite period an offer that has already been made.</mark> Such  an offer cannot be terminated during the term specified in such contract or if  no term is specified the offer must be kept open for a reasonable time.
**Cross Offers**
There is generally no contract if <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">two persons make identical offers</mark>, neither  party knowing of other’s offer when he made his own.
> In Tinn Vs Hoffman  and Co1, the two parties exchanged the same offer of 800 tons of iron at 69  shillings per ton on the same day, however the offer cannot be enforced  because there was no acceptance to both offer.  

**Counter – Offers**
When there is <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">no inconsistency</mark> between an offer and acceptance, there will  be a binding agreement. This means that the offeree must accept all the  terms of the offer.

### How the offer can be Terminated  
- Acceptance
- The death of offered
- Counter-offer/Qualified acceptance
- Lapse of Time
- Revocation before acceptance  
- Failure of a condition precedent

#### Acceptance
Acceptance is a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">final and unqualified expression of assent to the terms of an  offer.</mark> 

**The requirements of acceptance**
- By whom offer should be accepted  : Ordinarily it is <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">only the offeree</mark> who is entitled to accept a revocable offer.
![[Pasted image 20230821172321.png]]
- Acceptance to be manifested : The acceptance of an offer <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">must be clearly and unmistakably communicated</mark> in order for the contract to be legally binding.
- Acceptance must be communicated  : Acceptance<mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;"> must be communicated to the offeror</mark> by the offeree or by his  authorized agent. 
![[Pasted image 20230821172853.png]]
> The postal rule is an exception to the general rule of contract formation and communication.

An acceptance sent through the mail becomes effective and legally binding as soon as it is posted, even if it hasn't yet been received by the offeror.

## Intention of creating a legally binding agreement

For an agreement to be considered a contract, the parties involved must<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;"> intend for the agreement to have legal consequences.</mark> In other words, they must intend to create legal obligations that can be enforced through the legal system.

## Valuable Consideration / Justa Causa  

**English Law Perspective:** In English Law, a contract is often viewed as a "bargain." For a contract to be considered binding and enforceable, there <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">must be an exchange of something of value</mark> between the parties.

**Roman-Dutch Law Perspective:** In Roman-Dutch Law, a contract is seen as <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">binding primarily because a "serious promise"</mark> has been made by one party to another. The focus is on the genuineness and seriousness of the promise itself, rather than the exchange of benefits and detriments.

In general case for a contract to be considered binding and enforceable, there must be an <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">exchange of something of value</mark> between the parties. This concept is known as "consideration." Consideration refers to the fact that both parties have given something of value in return for the promise made.

![[Pasted image 20230821181501.png]]
**Executory Consideration**
Consideration is labeled as 'executory' when the defendant's commitment is reciprocated with a counter-promise from the plaintiff. For instance, if Kala places an order for a motorbike from Bala, to be settled upon its delivery the following month, this scenario encompasses two enforceable pledges. Bala is bound to deliver the motorbike, and Kala is obligated to make the payment.

**Executed Consideration**
'Executed' consideration emerges when it is exchanged for the completion of an action. In such cases, the consideration is offered in response to the act's fulfillment.
![[Pasted image 20230821183036.png]]
**Past Consideration** 
Critical to note is the exclusion of past consideration. Pledges formed based on a promisee's prior service are considered invalid. If an individual vows to reimburse a sum in return for a past service by the promisee, it constitutes past consideration and **lacks legal merit**.

## Legal Restrictions and Public Policy Considerations on Contract

Contracts are subject to legal regulations to ensure their validity and enforceability. However, there are instances where contracts may be deemed illegal based on statutory provisions or common law principles. Certain statutes explicitly or implicitly prohibit the formation of specific types of contracts.

Moreover, contracts that have the potential to undermine the proper functioning of justice, jeopardize national security, defraud government revenue, or cause harm to public services are strictly prohibited. Additionally, contracts that promote sexual immorality or are contrary to the prevailing public policy and moral standards of a country are also considered unlawful.
