# Question 1

> [!question]
> Write an R code to create a vector with the elements 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110 and 120 and name the vector as “V1”

```r
## Q1.1
V1 <- c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120)
V1
```

> [!question]
> Write R codes to find mean, median and quartiles of the above numbers.

```r
## Q1.2
# Mean
V1_mean<-mean(V1)
V1_mean
# Median
V1_median<-median(V1)
V1_median
# Quartiles
V1_quartiles <- quantile(V1, c(0.25, 0.75))
V1_quartiles
```

> [!question]
> Write an R code to create a matrix with 4 rows and 3 columns by using the data from above vector V1 assigned row wise. Name the matrix as “M1”.

```r
## Q1.3
M1 <- matrix(V1, nrow = 4, ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)
```

![[Pasted image 20230917090417.png]]

> [!question]
> Write R codes to change the row names of M1 as “R1”, “R2”, “R3” and “R4”. And change the column names of M1 as “C1”, “C2” and “C3”. Get the screen shot of your output and attach to the word document.

```r
## Q1.4
rownames(M1) <- c("R1", "R2", "R3", "R4")
colnames(M1) <- c("C1", "C2", "C3")
```

# Question 2

> [!note]
> Table 1 shows the details of 10 employees working in an organization. Write R codes for each of the following.

> [!question]
> Create a data frame for Table 1 and name it as EmpData.

```r
emp_data <- data.frame(
  EmpID = c("01", "02", "03", "04", "05", "06", "07", "08", "09", "10"),

)
print(emp_data)
```

> [!question]
> Add 100 dollars bonus to Salary of each employee

```r
## Q2.2
# Add a $100 bonus to each employee's salary
emp_data$Salary <- emp_data$Salary + 100
```

![[Pasted image 20230917090827.png]]

> [!question]
> Obtain the details of the employees who are attached to the FINANCE department.

```r

```

![[Pasted image 20230917090951.png]]

> [!question]
> Obtain the EmpName of the employers whose salary is above 600 dollars.

# Question 3

> [!note]
> Consider the “mtcars” R inbuild data set. Figure 1 shows the first six observations out of 32 observations of the mtcars data set.

> [!question]
> Create a suitable plot to visualize miles per gallon (mpg) of the vehicles.

```r
## Q3.1
data(mtcars)

     main = "Distribution of Miles Per Gallon",
     xlab = "Miles Per Gallon",
     ylab = "Frequency",
     col = "lightblue",
     border = "black")
```

> [!question]
> Crete a suitable plot to visualize the displacement (disp) of automatic and manual vehicles separately in a single plot. Get the screen shot of your output and attach to the word document

```r
## Q3.2
boxplot(disp ~ am, data = mtcars,
        main = "Displacement by Transmission Type",
        xlab = "Transmission Type",

> [!question]
> Obtain the descriptive statistics for the variable wt.

```r
## Q3.3
summary(mtcars$wt)
```

![[Pasted image 20230917091837.png]]

> [!question]
